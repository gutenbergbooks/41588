<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>The following pages have not been written
to supplement the thousands of guide
books about Europe. Long, technical descriptions
have been avoided. An endeavor has been
made, rather, to give our personal impressions
of the Old World from a motor car. Our
itinerary overlooked the larger cities whose
contents have been so well inventoried by
Baedeker. The life of the peasantry, the small
towns seldom visited by American tourists,
quaint villages unapproached by any railroad,
the superb roads and views of the Tyrol, the
crossing of the Alps over the snow-crowned
Stelvio into Italy, the flight through northern
Italy to Como, loveliest of the Italian lakes&mdash;such
unique experiences amid beautiful scenery
appealed to us more than the attractions of
the crowded metropolis. We were out for a
motor ramble instead of a sight-seeing tour.
Our route did not follow entirely the familiar
highways of tourist traffic. From the summit
of the Alps we were to see, far below us, the
valleys of picturesque Savoy. Then came the
long, thrilling descent into France through
Provençe, that treasure land of Roman antiquity,
through the Pyrenees, lifting their huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
barriers between France and Spain, to Biarritz
on the Atlantic. Spain was before us, the
pastoral beauties of Limousin and Périgord,
the châteaux of Touraine, and the cathedrals
of Normandy.</p>

<p>An important part of our equipment was the
<i>Michelin Guide</i>, which, with its convenient
arrangement and wealth of useful information
about hotels and roads, rendered invaluable
aid. Its maps were so clear that it was seldom
necessary to retrace our path. By means of
them we planned our route and found our way
through the different countries.</p>

<p>The writer wishes to thank Michelin &amp; Co.
of Paris, and Dr. Lehmann of the Benz Company
in Mannheim, Germany, for their assistance
and advice. The files of the <i>London Daily
Mail</i> contributed helpful suggestions. Obligation
is also expressed to Mr. Charles Netcher,
whose good judgment and motormanship were
indispensable to the success of the trip.</p>

BERLIN TO MARIENBAD</h2>


<p>Before us was the long stretch of the
Potsdamer Strasse bathed in the sunshine
of a July morning. Slowly the speedometer
began to devour the kilometers of the Kaiser's
imperial city, and the low music of the siren
seemed like a song of rejoicing that we were at
last starting on our quest of motor experiences
along the highways of Europe. The exhilaration
of the moment called for speed, a leaping
burst of it, but a Berlin street is unfortunately
no place for speeding. Numerous
helmeted policemen, vigilant guardians of German
speed laws, were sufficient reminders that
the way of the motor transgressor would be
paved with heavy fines.</p>

<p>These policemen looked like soldiers. In
Berlin one is always surrounded by a military
atmosphere. The city is the product
and the producer of this martial spirit. The
Prussian wars are written so completely in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
pages of bronze and marble, one has the
impression of being among people who are on
the verge of war and prepared for it. Even
as we glided along, a huge Zeppelin air ship
hovered above us, one of those ill-fated war
machines which have so often met destruction.</p>

<p>A little farther on, there was a stirring sound
of military music, and our way was intercepted
by a marching regiment. It was fully ten minutes
before the last soldier passed. Such scenes
are common in the capital of a country
bounded on two frontiers by powerful nations,
and dependent for its very existence upon the
maintenance of a large standing army.</p>

<p>Gradually the music grew fainter, the warnings
of countless "verbotens" became less frequent.
Soon we were riding through the
Prussian country, pleasantly pastoral and
interspersed by red-roofed villages. Everywhere
were barracks and soldiers, and each
small community was throbbing with industrial
life. This was prosaic, military, modern
Germany; that is, it might have seemed
prosaic had we not seen it from a motor car.
There is a quality of romance about all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
motoring in Europe. It is fascinating to appear
unexpectedly among a people in the midst of
their everyday activities, to see them as they
really are, to flash for a brief moment upon the
horizon of their local life, and then to whirl on
to other scenes. Such a trip is never monotonous.
There is magic in this song of the swift
kilometers.</p>

<p>The tourist, by train or on foot, is overwhelmed
by details. He sees small cross-sections
of life. But the motorist, of all
travelers, can see larger outlines. For him a
thousand details merge to form a unit which he
can grasp; to paint a picture of clear-cut,
dominating impressions and filled with life-long
memories. Even "the best traveler<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> on foot&mdash;Barrow
or Stevenson&mdash;can enjoy himself, or
interest others, only by his impressions of the
insistent details of each trudged mile. The
motorist alone can perform the great deduction
of travel. His privilege is to see the surface
of his planet and the activities of his fellowmen
unroll in impressive continuity. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
moves along the vital lines of cause and effect.
He sees how the earth has imposed character
and habits upon her inhabitants."</p>

<p>When one has seen Europe from a motor car,
the geography of the Old World ceases to be a
mass of hazy facts set off by indefinite boundaries.
We had vaguely thought of the Alps
as being in Switzerland. After crossing them
twice, these mountain barriers, extending from
Vienna to the Mediterranean, through Austria,
Switzerland, Italy, and France, were to have a
new meaning. Most of us would probably confuse
the old provinces of France with the
departments which correspond roughly to our
states. But Normandy, Brittany, and Provençe
have no more geographical significance
to-day than "Mason and Dixon's Line," which
once served as a boundary between North and
South. Places which had previously existed
for us, in cold print, were to glow with life and
color, and were in turn to tell their romantic
story. Now, when we look at our map of
France, we can see "the great central wheat
plain; the broad wine belt; the western <i>landes</i>;
the eastern pine slopes; the welter of history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
in Touraine and Anjou; dear, yellow, dusty,
windswept, singing, dancing, Provençe; the
southward climatic procession of buckwheat,
wheat, vine, olive, palm, and orange tree."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Our chronicle of this first day of motoring includes
a brief glimpse of Wittenberg, where
Luther burned the Papal Bull and thus kindled
the flame of the Reformation. After Wittenberg
came Leipzig, famed as the home of immortal
Baedeker. One cannot ride far in Germany
without encountering a city counting its population
by the hundred thousand. This wealth
of population explains in part how Prussia,
only a generation ago so agricultural, could
have changed so quickly into a vast workshop;
there has always been a plentiful supply of labor.</p>

<p>We stopped for the night at Chemnitz, a
smoky city and with a dreary looking hotel
showing in prominent letters the unpleasant
name of "Hotel zur Stadt Gotha." The next
morning we ran the easy gauntlet of customhouse
formalities at Gottesgab, and crossed the
Austrian frontier into Bohemia, that land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
shadows and thorn in the flesh of the Austrian
government where the gay colors of peasant
dress hardly conceal the evidences of poverty
and squalid misery, and where hunger appears
to be driving out plenty. It is a country of
peasants. There are millions of them, back in
the Middle Ages as to their agricultural methods,
unable to adapt themselves to the harsh, progressive
realities of the present, and careless
whether the abundant meal of to-morrow will
make up for the meager repast of to-day.</p>

<p>If you wish to see real misery, and to understand
why the Bohemians emigrate in such
great numbers to the United States, then take
a motor trip through this most discontented
and unhappy of all the Austrian provinces.
Here amid picturesque and beautiful scenery
one finds the rural slums of Europe. The small
farm hamlets look forlorn and unkempt, the
barnyards disorderly, the towns dirty and
neglected, the people as if they were both the
cause and effect of these conditions. It is a
common sight of the road to see women
harnessed with dogs or oxen. Here even
wooden shoes would be something of a luxury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>There is something fascinating about exploring
these neglected corners of Europe in a
motor car. The dress of the peasants is gay
even though ragged, their life picturesque even
in its poverty. One finds lights as well as
shadows in the picture. Nature has softened
the harsh lines of peasant life with dreamy,
misty horizons, with pine-clad hills and dashing
brooks, with pleasant vistas of distant mountains.</p>

<p>On reaching Carlsbad about noon we found
the season of this fashionable watering place at
its height. Crowds of visitors were promenading
in the street, returning from the baths and
springs or trying to stimulate jaded appetites
by a few breaths of the fine invigorating air.
The place is really beautiful with its fine setting
of Bohemian mountains.</p>

<p>Friends were expecting us in Marienbad, so
we resumed our journey early in the afternoon.
This stretch of forty miles lay through the
loveliest part of Bohemia. Such depths of blue
atmosphere melting into the green of pine
forests!</p>

<p>The forestry system of Bohemia is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to admire and to study. For generations,
governmental inspection has been tireless in its
efforts to improve and develop the forests.
There are many large estates which have their
own private foresters; no opportunity for tree
planting is neglected. On the smaller farms, if
the soil is not adapted to the raising of fruits
and vegetables, the state tells the farmer what
trees will flourish best in that kind of soil.
Thus no acre is wasted. Twice a year the
official inspector decides what trees may be cut.
If, during the year, some farmer wishes lumber,
it is the inspector who decides what trees, if
any, may be cut. No sooner has the tree fallen
than a fresh sapling takes its place. The trees
are planted in regular rows. There is no
crowding. In such a land, forestry is a distinguished
profession.</p>

<p>For some distance the valley narrowed almost
to a cañon. Then wider views opened, until
from a wooded ridge we saw below us in the
valley the village of Marienbad. Nature was
good to her children when she fashioned this
rare resort, lying so white and clean in its green
cradle of high pine-covered hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Much too briefly must we give our impressions
of life at a Bohemian watering place.
Every one lives out of doors. The many villas
are generously provided with balconies to catch
the sunshine and pine breezes. Unlike most
health resorts, the atmosphere of the sick room
is absent. Few invalids are to be seen. Most
of the <i>Kurgäste</i> come here for the purpose of
reducing their weight. Their chief rule of life
is to eat little and exercise much. The numerous
tennis courts are constantly filled. The
mountains invite to long walks. There are hot
baths, steam baths, mud baths, and baths that
would probably have been new even to the bath-loving
Romans. The gymnasia are elaborately
equipped with exercising apparatus. If one
wishes to watch another phase of this struggle
against excessive avoirdupois, he should rise at
a dim gray hour and walk over to the Promenade.
People of every nationality crowd about
the mineral springs and then, with their glasses
well filled, they take their places in the cosmopolitan
throng which moves slowly up and
down the long Promenade. One hears the
confused murmuring of many voices in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
languages, the favorite topics of this linguistic
Babel relating to various ailments and the
weight-reducing qualities of different mineral
waters. A less corpulent arrival is looked upon
with envy. Slowly the glasses are emptied,
and then again filled. It is customary to walk
up and down for an hour, while drinking two
glasses of mineral water. With each swallow
the <i>Kurgäste</i> appear to be imbibing the hopes
of their diminishing avoirdupois. The Germans
are in the majority. They are always
desperately conscientious in their endeavor to
meet all the requirements of this simple but
exacting life, possibly because they realize that
a long devotion to beer and sandwiches is not
the best means to preserve the youthful figure.
Near the Promenade are weighing shops. A
place like Marienbad naturally includes among
its habitués some who could easily qualify for
the monstrosity class. We remember one
Egyptian phenomenon of enormous proportions
who had to have his own private scales.</p>

<p>After the hour at the spring comes a strenuous
half-hour climb to a hilltop restaurant
where breakfast is served. How inviting those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
repasts in the open air! The coffee is as good
as can be found anywhere in Europe, and the
scrambled eggs and <i>Schinken aus Prague</i> are
served by pretty Bohemian waitresses arrayed
in all the colors of their native costumes. At
these hilltop restaurants orchestra music is
always an attractive feature of the breakfast.</p>

</div>

<p>One is never sure what distinguished statesmen
or prince of royal blood is sitting near by.
While we were breakfasting one morning a
gentleman dressed in an ordinary business suit
approached and sat alone at a table close at
hand. We learned later that he was the Prime
Minister of Russia.</p>

<p>The activities and diversions of the day
would be incomplete without a stroll after
dinner down the pleasant Kaiserstrasse. At
this evening hour all the visitors to Marienbad
pass in leisurely review. The Austrian officers,
erect and soldierly, make quite a striking appearance.
Our attention was also attracted to
the monks of Tepl, with their long black cloaks
and broad-brimmed hats. They are the owners
of Marienbad, and live in a monastery
situated a few miles from the village. About<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
two centuries ago the monks of Tepl began to
realize the commercial possibilities of their
springs. Forests were cut away; streets were
laid; marshes blossomed into gardens and
green lawns; splendid buildings were erected
for patrons who wished to take the various
baths, and to-day Marienbad is a village of
hotels and villas. Last year there were about
forty thousand visitors. The monks whom we
saw looked sleek and well-fed. They lead an
easy life, hunting, fishing, and managing their
lucrative property. The monastic vow of
poverty has probably long since ceased to
mean much of a hardship.</p>

<p>This fact of a modern village being controlled
by a wealthy religious organization dating as far
back as 1133 is most unique. It is doubtful if
a parallel case can be found anywhere. The
town shows in many ways the influence of its
monastic administration. Licensed gambling
halls, which are so prevalent in all of the French
watering places, do not exist here. There is no
night life. After ten o'clock in the evening the
streets begin to look deserted. Amusement
places of doubtful character have thus far found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
no footing in this simple village life. Considering
the thousands of idle and pleasure-loving
Europeans who throng every year to Marienbad,
it seems remarkable that the general tone
of the place should have been kept so high.</p>

MARIENBAD TO TRAFOI</h2>


<p>Even a congenial environment like that of
Marienbad began to lack interest when
we looked at our motor itinerary and saw
awaiting us such rich experiences as climbing
above the clouds over the snowbound Stelvio,
or the sight of Carcassonne, tower-girt and
formidable behind feudal walls. The call of
the white road was irresistible when it led
through the purple valleys of the Pyrenees to
beautiful Biarritz on the Atlantic and to San
Sebastian in Spain, where the Spanish king and
queen hold summer court. The perfect day of
blue skies added its persuasive voice.</p>

<p>We were again on the road. The villas of
Marienbad withdrew behind the mountains,
and we settled down to the complete enjoyment
of the ride through Bohemia and southern Germany
to Munich. On either side were quaint
scenes of Bohemian life. Every little farm
hamlet had its pond of geese, with a goose girl
tending her flocks. One of them threw us a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
flower. Her action meant more to us than she
thought; it was a happy omen for the rest of the
trip. Peasant women were toiling barefooted
in the fields, or trudging along the road, bending
under heavy burdens of wood. This human
element in the scene was impressive. Here, as
everywhere, the great drama of human life was
being played. But the role of the actors was
such a humble and pathetic one, so much of the
land was given over to unfruitful fields, half
cleared of stumps! There were no such pictures
of content and prosperity as one finds
everywhere in Germany and Holland. The
houses were scarcely more than huts.</p>

<p>We halted in some of the towns to take a first
lesson in the Czeck or Bohemian dialect. The
store signs were mysterious, with their hieroglyphics.
One shop contained sewing machines,
and the word "Singowiski" above the
door hinted that this might be the Bohemian
translation of Singer sewing machines. Road
signs were not always visible, and less often
intelligible. Then we were obliged to ask the
way. If the source of our information was a
town official he usually spoke in German,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
otherwise in Bohemian, an answer which did
not relieve us of our uncertainty.</p>

<p>The German frontier was reached about
noon. Our <i>Triptyque</i> received the customary
official stamping at the <i>Zoll-amt</i>. To our great
relief, no questions were asked about <i>Pichner
Torte</i>, a very delicious kind of cake made only
in Austria, and so good that tourists always lay
in ample supplies. Such articles as a rule are
heavily taxed at the Austrian frontier.</p>

<p>Just at this moment Looloo, our French bull
terrier, became sick. The shock of coming so
suddenly into German territory was probably
too much for her sensitive French temperament,
but she soon revived after eating a piece of
French dog biscuit. We lunched at a <i>Gasthaus</i>
in the small town of Furth im Walde. The first
word on the wall which caught our attention
was "<i>Ausstellung</i>." That was enough to make
us feel that we were once more in the Fatherland.
The Germans seem to be always holding
or advertising exhibitions and fairs. "<i>Ausstellung</i>"
and "<i>Practisch</i>" need have no immediate
fear of losing their place in the vocabulary of
the average German. There was no doubt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
our being in Germany. We would have known
it from the trim, clean farms. Order and thrift
were in evidence, every stick of every wood pile
in place&mdash;all such a contrast to Bohemian
untidiness.</p>

<p>Once more in the land of the Kaiser, and
motoring through picturesque Bavaria, slow
changing and old-fashioned, the mediæval part
of modern Germany, a region of small towns
and peasant farms. We were often delayed to
pay the <i>Zoll</i> of a few <i>pfennigs</i>. The impost
was not onerous, but it was inconvenient to stop
so often. Frequently a little girl or small boy
would come out to collect our <i>pfennigs</i>, and
would hold up flowers for us to purchase. On
one occasion we saw an aged collector of tolls
apparently overburdened by official cares, his
head sunk in slumber, and a large beer stein on
a table near him. The picture was so characteristic
of the slow-moving life around us!</p>

<p>Our motor flight through this fascinating
region of Germany afforded opportunity to
observe how the different towns had striven for
a style of architecture original and unique.
The houses had much warmth of color, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
more than one would see in northern Germany.
But then Bavaria is of course closer to Italy, and
to the vivid landscapes, the bright sunny skies
of the southland, and this difference in climate
is naturally reflected in the life of the people.
It is not surprising that the great artists of
Germany should have come from the south.</p>

<p>We remember vividly the town of Straubing,
where we stopped to buy gasoline. In the
middle of the street an old-fashioned clock
tower rose above the red-tiled roofs and gabled
houses. Many of the homes had attractive
window gardens; red and blue were the prevailing
colors. No one was in a hurry; life
moved with a leisurely swing. Baedeker barely
mentions Straubing, but we doubt if Nurnberg
or Munich could show a street more typically
south German or better worth the artist's brush.</p>

<p>At this point should be mentioned the happy
discovery of the lunch box which thoughtful
friends had stowed away with the baggage.
There had been so much to attract our attention
that we had overlooked it. Our motor
appetites were equal to the occasion; fruit,
cakes, and cold chicken sandwiches received no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
mercy. It is unnecessary to add that scenery
and sandwiches went well together, especially
such scenery and such sandwiches.</p>

<p>The landscapes were not more varied than
the weather. At times the road was wet where
a shower had just preceded us. All day the
sunshine had brightened and faded. Now we
noticed a battalion of dark clouds massing
heavily above us; little by little the blue sky
surrendered to the storm king; the artillery of
heaven thundered into action. It was worth a
wetting to see the storm sweep toward us and
then fade into the gorgeous sunset which closed
the day. The church spires of Munich were
luminous in the golden light. Swiftly we sped
down the long, straight road into the city.
When we stopped before the comfortable Regina
Palast Hotel our speedometer registered one
hundred and eighty-five miles, the longest run
of the trip. The country ahead of us was to
prove too interesting for any attempt at long-distance
records.</p>

<p>The evening gave a pleasant glimpse of
Bavarian life, of its good cheer and warm spirit
of hospitality, so in contrast with the colder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
social customs of the north. The Berliner is
reserved, exclusive. When he enters a café
he would like, if possible, a table where he can
sit alone. But Bavarian sociability is all-pervasive.
The café where we passed an hour
or so was filled with it. Tyrolean warblers in
native costume occupied the stage fashioned to
portray a bit of south German landscape. Song
books were handed us. Every one joined in
singing the rollicking folk songs. Of course the
evening would have been incomplete without a
visit to the famous <i>Brauerei</i> and a cooling
sample of <i>Münchner Brau</i>.</p>

<p>After a couple of days in Munich we departed
for Landeck, in the Austrian Tyrol, a ride of one
hundred and eighty-two kilometers. For some
distance our course was the same as the route to
Ober-Ammergau. Lunch at a wayside inn included
<i>Gänsebraten</i>, which can only be described
as "<i>ausgezeichnet</i>." Bright Tyrolese landscapes
flew by. It was glorious running, the air
buoyant with the breath of the mountains,
which rose in a jagged, majestic profile above
little villages where the houses were painted
with queer scenes of peasant life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>At Garmisch we were in the heart of the
Bavarian Tyrol. It was a good place to stop
for a few minutes to watch the people, the
women almost theatrical in the gay colors of
their dress, the men equally gorgeous with their
red neckties, green hats and vests, to say
nothing of green leggings which left knee and
ankle bare. Every one wore the feather.
Garmisch is not far from the Austrian frontier,
so we purchased five liters of gasoline, this
necessary article being much more expensive in
Austria than elsewhere in Europe. Indeed, on
reaching the <i>Zoll-amt</i> at Griesen we found that
gasoline had jumped from forty-five or fifty
<i>pfennigs</i> to a <i>kronen</i> a liter, an increase of about
eight cents. The Austrian officials made us
pay a duty of ninety <i>heller</i> on the five liters of
gasoline which we carried as reserve. They
also enriched the treasury of their government
by a duty of 3.60 <i>kronen</i> on our twelve liters of
oil, and thoughtfully suggested that we purchase
five additional liters of gasoline at the Austrian
rates. In view of our purchase in Garmisch,
this invitation was declined. Had we carried
a spare wheel and covers, they would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
requested us to remove them and would have
weighed them in an outhouse opposite the <i>Zoll-amt</i>.
It is customary to charge duty on tires
if the equipment be above a certain weight. If
one carries the average equipment, there is
usually no trouble.</p>

<p>Just across the frontier a sign post, bearing
the word "<i>Rechtsfahren</i>," reminded us of the
change in the rule of the road. The scenery
grew wilder. Nowhere in Europe can be found
a more perfect country for the motorist than the
Austrian Tyrol, with its splendid roads and incomparable
scenery. Steadily the road circled
and climbed. It was the sunset hour. Shadows
were creeping out of deep valleys; a snowy
mountain was turning to a lovely rose color
in the crucible of the afterglow. Far down
among the shadows we spied a little lake, still
and black under the overhanging mountains.</p>

<p>The Post-Hotel in Landeck was surprisingly
good. It is located right on the river Inn,
which rushes noisily through the middle of the
town. After an excellent <i>Abendessen</i> we retired
early, and were not long in yielding to the
drowsy roar of the waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Breakfast was followed by an animated scene
in front of our hotel. Amid a medley of motor
horns, other cars were also departing. As we
ascended beyond Landeck, the road swung
with easy grades above the magnificent gorge of
the Hoch Finstermünz pass, where we stopped
for a picture. The ride from this point over
the Reschen-scheideck pass was simply indescribable.
In that exhilarating air, one seemed
to be flying instead of motoring. We plunged
through rocky tunnels, or hesitated as the road
appeared to leap off into the abyss or the
towering rock masses seemed to sweep forward
as if to bar further progress. Then would
come a sharp turn, opening up a new sweep of
highway. The road was as good as we found
anywhere on the trip, and wide enough for the
motor cars that occasionally passed us. But
accidents could easily have happened at the
curves. Sure brakes and a tireless motor horn
are invaluable at these critical moments.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant surprise at Reschen to see a
cozy villa flying the American flag, and to discover
acquaintances in this secluded corner
of the Old World. We had forgotten that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
buckwheat cakes could be so good. Our
departure was accompanied with warnings
about the difficulties of the Stelvio, which
we were to climb the next day.</p>

<p>After being shown the picture of this most
formidable of mountain roads, with its serpentine
windings, rising mile upon mile, and finally
disappearing above the clouds, we wondered if
the car could possibly ascend such a barrier,
and if it would not be better to reach Italy by
some less dangerous route. One motorist had
attempted the feat a few weeks before, and
after climbing eight thousand feet was forced
to turn back on account of deep snowdrifts.
Mention was also made of a particularly
dangerous curve where there had once been a
fatal accident. These reports were not encouraging,
but nevertheless we wanted to make the
attempt. Every one who motors in the Austrian
Tyrol has but one dream, one ambition&mdash;to
submit his skill and car to the supreme test
of scaling the Stelvio.</p>

<p>From Reschen the car ran along a pretty lake,
then shot down a long grade to Mals and from
there wound along to Neu Spondinig, where we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>stopped for a few minutes for tea and to
exchange motor experiences with other travelers,
on their way to Landeck over the same
route by which we had come.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo_043.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Cutting across the glacier</i> <i>Page 38</i></span>
</div>

<p>Leaving Neu Spondinig, we turned sharply
to the right and into the gloom of a deep gorge,
crossing the bridges of the impetuous Trafoier
Bach and climbing for several kilometers to
Trafoi, where a most marvelous view burst upon
us. Until this moment the high walls of the
gorge had shut us in, but now the road suddenly
opened into a view so magnificent as to seem
almost unreal. We were directly under the
shadow of the Ortler, with its twelve thousand
feet of rock and ice. The glittering whiteness
of the Madatsch glacier formed with its ice
floods a veritable <i>mer de glace</i>. The scene
was so wild, the impression so overwhelming,
that for some minutes we forgot to order rooms
for the night at the fine Trafoi hotel.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
CROSSING THE STELVIO INTO ITALY</h2>


<p>It was before seven that we started on the long
climb. An early start is important when
the main care is to keep the engine cool. Cloudless
skies favored our attempt. Across the
gorge we saw the towering Weiskugel, its snows
turned to radiant silver while the valley was
still in shadow. The Ortler was transfigured,
the Madatsch dazzling&mdash;almost blinding until
our eyes had grown wonted to the brilliant
spectacle. Slowly the long grades sank behind
us. It seemed better to set a steady, even
though slow pace, and maintain it until the
summit was reached. So we were forced to use
second speed. The sides of the engine bonnet
had been tied back to give the engine every
possible bit of cool air. From "hairpin" to
"hairpin" we went, these curves so sharp that
at first it seemed impossible to make them without
backing. How they twisted above us like
the loops of a gigantic lasso flung far up the
mountain, into the region of eternal snow!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Imagine it! Forty-six of them! Only on one
turn were we forced to back, but with a large,
powerful car this record would have been impossible.
Any car that cannot turn easily in
a fifty-foot circle would better find some other
way of reaching Italy. It is not pleasant to
back up when the edge of the precipice is a
matter of inches.</p>

<p>When the Austrians built this road, a century
ago, they were not thinking about motor cars.
This masterpiece of road construction was
intended for armies, not for automobiles. The
makers of those curves, cut through heights
of solid rock, never anticipated the luxurious
modes of modern travel. If then they had
only foreseen the coming of motor warfare, how
much inconvenience would have been spared
the impetuous motorist who to-day attempts to
climb the Stelvio in a long, powerful car which
cannot quite make the turns without backing.
Surely, a few feet would have been added to
those tantalizing, agonizing curves. How little
the Austrians realized that their military invasion
would be followed by the more peaceful
motor invasion of our day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>With every turn, our admiration for this perfect
road increased. One marvels at such
matchless feats of engineering, at such gigantic
obstacles so completely overcome. Here, high
retaining walls have been built to keep the road
from crumbling away; there, mountain torrents
that would have washed it away have been
diverted. Turn after turn, and still higher to
go! Pine woods gave way to stunted shrubbery,
and then vegetation ceased altogether.
We were above the clouds. Nothing but the
sun above us. Snow banks appeared on either
side; we could put out our hands and touch
them. Then through Franzenshöhe, formerly
the seat of the Austrian customhouse, to Ferdinandshöhe
and the summit of Stelvio, 9,041
feet above the sea, the highest point of motor
or carriage travel in Europe.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the thrill, the
intoxication, of the moment as we stood there
watching the ice fields roll away in great waves,
as if the ocean, in a moment of wild upheaval,
had been frozen. Leaving the car near the
little Ferdinandshöhe hotel, we climbed an
elevation of one hundred and fifty feet to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Hotel Dreisprachenspitze, where one stands at
the apex of three countries. We could look
down into Italy. The ice floods of Switzerland
swept to the horizon; a hundred snow peaks
flashed in the morning sun. In the other
direction yawned the mighty gorge of the
Stelvio, where it had taken us two hours and
seven minutes to make eight miles. The wind
was of razor keenness.</p>

<p>On descending to arrange customhouse details
with the Austrian officials, we found the
car frozen in the ice. The hot steel-studded
tires had melted a deep groove, and were now
held fast in the prison of their own making.
Even on the Stelvio we had not expected to be
frozen fast on the first of August. In vain we
opened wide the throttle. The wheels turned
furiously without gaining an inch. Austrian
soldiers came to our rescue. Half a dozen of us
pushed from behind. Two American tourists
who had just climbed the Stelvio from the
Italian side in a Cadillac, also gave generous
aid. With the additional help of pickaxes and
quantities of sawdust, the car finally shook off
its icy fetters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile we had succeeded in snapping
some kodak pictures without attracting the
notice of the Austrian officers. The Stelvio
is a military road, various forts are in the neighborhood,
and the government regulations forbid
the taking of photographs. In securing these
pictures we ran the risk of heavier penalties
than the confiscation of the camera and films.</p>

<p>Fortune did not smile so cheerfully at the
Italian <i>dogana</i>, two miles farther down.
Hardly had we touched the kodak when Italian
soldiers and customhouse officers rushed toward
us. We were not sure whether we would be
shot on the spot or simply left to languish in an
Italian prison. One of the officers seized the
camera, tied a red string around it, and sealed
it. Observing that our ignorance of military
regulations was fully equal to our ignorance of
Italian, he instructed us in French not to open
the camera until we were beyond Tirano,
seventy miles away, the frontier town of the
military zone.</p>

<p>During the ascent the engine bore the chief
strain. It had worked heroically without once
faltering. Now, upon the long down grades of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the Italian slope, we were forced to rely upon
the brakes. The road descended with a continuous
and fairly steep gradient for almost
fourteen miles. It was dangerous, difficult
work. We not only had to make the turns,
which were just as sharp as on the Austrian side,
but it was necessary to watch the straining
brakes, releasing them when the grade permitted
and alternating the emergency brake
with compression. This was a feat demanding
all the qualities of motormanship. Coolness
and good judgment were indispensable at every
curve of the descent. The road turned icy
corners and edged along precipitous cliffs. If
the brakes had refused to work, it would have
been fatal; the downward plunge of the car
would have been beyond control in a few seconds.
But at that moment we were not thinking
of danger. The thrill of the descent, the
feeling of flying down from a great height, the
ice peaks that rose higher above us, the stupendous
chasm that at every curve opened
newer and more savage depths&mdash;these were all
a part of our exhilarating experience.</p>

<p>We were coasting much of the time; gasoline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and ignition had been cut off. Rocky walls
hurled back the blast of our motor horn as we
entered the slippery winter galleries of the
Diroccamento defile. According to law, no
vehicle may enter a tunnel if it is occupied.
Farther down, the road looped like the coils of
a great serpent, twisting, disappearing, only to
reappear farther down as a faint streak of
shimmering roadway. It was curious, that
sensation of falling, always sinking lower and
yet never reaching the bottom. One more
sweep through the Braulio Valley, and we
stopped for lunch before the luxurious hotel
Bagni-Nuovi, that popular watering place for
the leisure rich of Italy.</p>

<p>Our first repast upon Italian soil very fittingly
included macaroni and a generous <i>bottiglia di vino
italiano</i>. After lunch we went into the terraced
garden, fragrant with orange trees, overlooking
dreamy Bormio, the gateway of Italy. The
warm sunshine was delightful after having so
recently faced the icy winds of the Stelvio.</p>

<p>Here we joined an American party from
Detroit, Mr. and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, who were chaperoning
two attractive American girls on a motor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
trip through Italy and the Tyrol. They had
rented an Italian car in Rome, but had not
found the investment altogether satisfactory,
the usual story of rented cars in Europe. These
chance meetings with other Americans <i>en route</i>
were among the pleasantest features of our trip.
We would gladly have prolonged the visit, had
it not been necessary to leave early in the afternoon
if we were to reach Menaggio on Lake
Como before dark.</p>

<p>After descending into Bormio, one motors for
some distance between high, vine-clad slopes, and
then passes through two or three villages, typically
Italian with their dilapidated churches and
narrow, cobbled streets swarming with dirty
children, many of whom took a special delight in
darting across our track just as we were passing.</p>

<p>Northern Italy is wonderfully picturesque.
The long defile of S. Antonio Morignone, the
antiquated towns, the slender <i>campaniles</i> standing
out so clearly in the misty, dreamy landscape,
the plains of Lombardy with their
scenes of peasant life,&mdash;these were all interesting
details to be duly jotted down in the
notebook of memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>It was haying time. The farming methods
seemed so primitive; everything was hand
work. We did not see a single labor-saving
machine. The International Harvester Company
would not have done a profitable business
here. The hayricks were very small, and
even these were often lacking, for barefooted
women staggered under large bundles of hay.
Yet these backward farmers make stalwart
soldiers. Sturdy and frugal, they are, as in
France, the backbone and hope of the nation.
Europe recognizes the fine horsemanship of
the Italian cavalry. The "Corazzieri," or
royal bodyguard, is a magnificent corps. It
is difficult to believe that most of these men
are peasants.</p>

<p>There was no need of a compass to learn
that we were going west, for the afternoon sun
shone full in our faces. This steady glare,
and the dazzling reflection from the white,
dusty road, became almost unbearable. It
was constantly necessary to shield the eyes.
There was no winding or turning. Often we
overtook a hayrick occupying most of the
highway. The driver was usually invisible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>in the soft depths of the hay, and so drowsy
from the sun or liberal drafts of <i>chianti</i>
that persistent blasts of the motor horn were
necessary to attract his attention. Tresenda
was passed, and then Sondrio, the capital of
the fertile Val Tellina, noted for its wines.</p>

</div>

<p>The sun was a glowing disk upon the horizon
when we reached Colico upon Lake Como,
most beautiful of the Italian lakes. There
was a crimson light on the water. Red sails
drifted lazily toward the shore. Across the
lake the high mountains rose cone-like to a
peak, like extinct volcanoes. From a distant
bell tower floated the clear, sweet tones of the
angelus. Before some of the houses, young
Italians were playing melodies on guitars.
Twilight was falling, that wonderful twilight
so full of color and feeling, of the romance and
sentiment of northern Italy. After several
miles along the shore, through these fascinating
scenes, we reached Menaggio.</p>

<p>The evening in the cool lake garden of the
Grand Hotel was a refreshing sequel to the
afternoon's hot ride. We could see the government
searchlight sweeping its bright rays in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
search of smugglers. The Italian lakes are
partly in Italy and partly in Switzerland.
Salt and tobacco are state monopolies in Italy.
The poor people are forbidden even to pick
up from the docks the few grains of salt which
may have fallen during the loading and unloading
of ships. Guards patrol the beaches to
compel those who use the sea for a washtub,
thoroughly to wring the salt water from the
clothes. In spite of all the government's
precautions, large quantities of salt and tobacco
are smuggled in from Switzerland over the
Italian lakes. The Italian officials are poorly
paid. The operator of the searchlight which
we saw received only eight dollars a month.
The small salaries breed bribery and corruption,
and it often happens, therefore, that on
a dark night the government searchlight fails
to discover a rowboat that goes out from the
Swiss shore. The smugglers escape the vigilance
of the swift revenue cutters, and make
a successful landing on the Italian side.</p>

<p>The next day was so hot that it seemed best
to pass the time quietly at Menaggio, in our
restful retreat. The rooms were large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
airy, and open to the fresh lake breezes. The
hotel had once been a villa, and with its private
garden of thick plane trees was just such a
spot as the dusty motorist delights to stumble
upon after a long ride over the hot Italian
roads.</p>

<p>Our gasoline was running low, so noticing
a sign with the words <i>Benzino-Lubrificanti</i>, we
entered. The <i>commercianti</i> spoke as much
English as we spoke Italian. We compromised
on gestures. In Italy it is a safe rule to pay
about half the price asked. After half an hour
of bargaining we obtained five liters of gasoline
for forty-five <i>centesimi</i> a liter. The price
demanded at first was ninety-five <i>centesimi</i>.
Our change included a couple of five-lira notes
so dirty, greasy, and mangled that they looked
in the last stages of the plague. We would
have felt safer to have handled them with
tongs. Within a few days we had received
<i>kronen</i>, <i>heller</i>, <i>marks</i>, <i>pfennigs</i>, <i>lira</i>, <i>centesimi</i>.
It was quite an education in the currency
systems of Europe.</p>

<p>On the way back to the hotel we entered
the cathedral. To find so imposing an edifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
amid so much poverty was a surprise. Equally
astonishing was the way the steep hills behind
the town were terraced and cultivated, as
though the very rocks themselves had been
made to blossom and bear fruit. An Italian
woman across the street was filling her jug
at a fountain. The nozzle, crumpled into a
trefoil, was of the same style as that used by
the Roman matrons twenty-five centuries
ago. Little things like this show how slowly
time has marched in these lake towns of
northern Italy.</p>

<p>The cool fragrance of early morning filled
the air when we waved <i>addio</i> to our <i>padrone</i>
and followed the curves of the shore toward
Como at the end of the lake. There is much
in favor of an early start before the heat begins
to quiver above the road and the air to resemble
a continuous cloud of dust. Every foot of
the way was interesting. There were bright-colored
villas half smothered in vines; crumbling
bell towers flung their shadows across
our path; dizzy cliffs hung above us; the lake
was constantly within view.</p>

<p>At one of the turns a bicycle rider shot by.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a><br /></span>We missed him by an inch. He was followed
by many others, scattered over the distance
of a mile. They were all riding recklessly,
rounding the corners at top speed and with
heads bent low over the handle bars. Different
numbers were pinned on their backs. This
was evidently a long-distance bicycle race.
It was nerve racking to meet so many curves
and not to know whether the riders would
pass us on the right or on the left. There is
no fixed rule of the road in Italy. In towns
having a tram, one turns to the left. Southern
Italy is still more confusing, since each town
has its own rule. In Como we motored down
two or three streets before finally discovering,
after many inquiries, the road running northward
to Aosta in the Italian Alps.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><i>Italian villas on Lake Como</i></p>
<p class="center">Copyright by Underwood &amp; Underwood</p></div>
</div>

<p>We regretted our last glimpse of the lake.
Instead of hazy mountains, blue sparkling
waters, red sails, and pretty villas, the scenery
changed to flat, uninteresting country. Novara
was reached by noon, its streets baking
in the fierce August sun. At the Hotel Italia
the flies covered table and dishes. The ménu
card presented difficulties; it was written in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
a very illegible Italian. We guessed at most
of the courses, but macaroni was the only dish
of which we were sure. But our plight was
not quite so discouraging as that of another
motorist who found that for three of his courses
he had ordered eggs cooked in three different
ways. The early afternoon was so hot that
we had thought of taking a siesta, but soon
gave up the idea. There were too many flies.
The inmates of the garage were all fast asleep,
and the two blinking men whom we aroused
could not conceal their surprise at our unseasonable
departure.</p>

<p>Once out in the country, the dust invaded
and pervaded everything. It was real Italian
dust, that sifted into us and all but blinded
us. The heat was terrific. For fear of bursting
a tire, we halted in a drowsy village to let
the car cool off under a shady chestnut tree.
As if by magic, a score of dirty, ragged Italian
children surrounded us, and begged for <i>centesimi</i>.
We threw them a few coppers, but this
vision of riches only served to redouble the
clamor. Flight seemed the only price of
tranquillity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>A little way outside the village, a cloud
rolled swiftly toward us. The motor car did
not appear to be much more than a cloud when
it passed us, so thick was the dust. If there
is anything hotter or dustier than an Italian
highway on the third of August, we do not
wish to see it. The drivers of most of the
small carts were curled up, content to let the
patient mule take its own pace, provided their
siesta was undisturbed. The shrill call of our
horn often caused them to move a little; there
would be a slight twitching of the reins, and
then they would relax again into slumber.
The mule never changed its course.</p>

<p>Beyond Ivrea the country became more
rolling and broken, and the Alps, which an
hour before had appeared as blue, shadowy
cloud masses, now lifted bold, distinct outlines.
This contrast in scenery was as abrupt as it
was impressive. Perhaps it was a ruined
castle perched like an eagle's nest amid high
crags. Within the same view, the eye beheld
the vineyards, not planted in the usual manner
of row above row, but arbor above arbor,
supported by white stone pillars, and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
arbors rising to the very summit of lofty hills.</p>

<p>The road which had been winding and rising
above the magnificent valley of Aosta now
ran into a level stretch. We had opened wide
the throttle, when all at once a motor car
flashed around a curve two hundred yards
ahead of us. An officer in the back seat
waved to attract our attention, and kept
pointing back to the curve. The warning
was just in time, for as we waited within the
shadow of the bend, another motor car shot
at racing speed around the curve. She was
a French racer. There had been no warning
shriek of her horns; the road was so narrow
at this point that a collision could hardly
have been avoided without that precious second
of warning.</p>

<p>Every year in Europe reckless driving causes
more accidents than all the steep roads of the
Alps. This is the chief danger of motoring
on the Continent. The roads are so good that
there is the constant temptation to disregard
the still small voice of prudence.</p>

<p>The old Roman town of Aosta was in sight.
This "Rome of the Alps" is a perfect treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
house of antiquities. Passing under ancient
Roman arches, we rode down the quaint main
streets to the Hotel Royal Victoria, situated,
according to our <i>Michelin Guide</i>, "<i>près de la
gare</i>." The hotel, although small, was clean.
This fact of cleanliness speaks much for any
hotel located in a small Italian town.</p>

<p>Our morning promenade revealed much that
was interesting. The middle of some of the
streets was traversed by a mountain stream,
the above-ground sewage system of Aosta.
It was curious to notice how a part of the
ancient Roman theater had become the supporting
wall of a crowded tenement house.
Aosta remains to-day almost undiscovered to
the American tourist world. Yet there are
few places where antiquity speaks more vividly.
The market place was a scene of activity.
This is the starting point for the crossing of
the Petit St. Bernard pass. Here tourists
were climbing into large excursion automobiles,
and German mountain climbers were setting
out, well equipped with long, iron-pointed
poles, ice picks, ropes, and heavy spiked shoes
for their battle with snow and ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>It was ideal weather for our second conquest
of the Alps over the Petit St. Bernard,
which is closed eight months out of the year.
While very dangerous in places, the pass is
free from the restrictions which the motorist
finds on the Simplon. There, one has to give
notice in writing of intention to cross. It is
also necessary to pay five francs for a permit.
The speed limit of six miles an hour is rigidly
enforced. Nevertheless, as one experienced
motorist told us, if the Simplon pass compels
a speed of six miles an hour on the straight
course, and one and three-fourths miles at
the curves, the Petit St. Bernard ought to
have a special speed-limit of three miles an
hour on the straight and two guards at every
corner. Except the Stelvio, there is probably
not a more difficult mountain pass in Europe.</p>

<p>We left Aosta to its memories of Roman
days, threaded for some distance the tortuous
windings of the Val d'Aosta, and crossed the
Pont de la Salle above a high gorge. Near
the ancient village of Pré St. Didier a rocky
tunnel buried us temporarily from the outer
world. Here the ascent began, and continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>for some miles to La Thuile, the Italian <i>dogana</i>.
As we climbed out of the valley the panorama
included a sublime view of Mont Blanc,
highest of the Alps.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo_069.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><i>Above the Val d'Aosta</i></p>
<p class="center">Copyright by Underwood &amp; Underwood</p></div>
</div>

<p>At La Thuile, two Frenchmen, about to make
the ascent on motor cycles, cautioned us about
the dangers of the climb. The customhouse
officials were unusually affable, and were
delighted to be included in a group picture.
Then the long climb of six miles to the summit
began to reveal dangers and difficulties.
One sharp curve followed another. We soon
overtook the French motor cyclists. They were
walking, having found the ascent too steep. It
was thrilling to be able to look down into the
sunshine and fertility of Italy and then to
observe the barren world of rock and snow into
which we had risen. The engine proved equal
to the severe test. We used the same tactics
which were so successful on the Stelvio, keeping
the same pace until the summit was gained,
where we let the car rest near the world-famous
Hospice du Petit St. Bernard. Other
cars had halted in succession, having made the
ascent from the French side <i>en tour</i> to Italy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>There was missing one interesting personality
who had greeted visitors to the <i>hospice</i> in
other years, the Abbé Chanoux, for fifty years
rector of the <i>hospice</i> and the last patriarch
of that legendary region of the Alps. The
<i>hospices</i> of the Grand St. Bernard, and of the
Simplon in Swiss territory, are managed by
priests, but the Abbé Chanoux reigned alone
in his mountain hospital, assisted by a few
helpers and by his dogs. For half a century
it was always a joy, when he saw some traveler
less hurried than the others, to offer him a
glass of <i>muscat</i> in his workshop and then,
after having shown his garden of Alpine
plants, to point out the shortest road to La
Thuile. To-day the tourist can see the
Alpine garden and the grave where, at the
age of eighty-one years, Abbé Chanoux was
buried. The resting place is where he wished
it to be, in view of Italy, France, Mont Blanc,
and his beloved <i>hospice</i>.</p>

<p>Just beyond the <i>hospice</i> is a Roman column
of rough marble bearing the statue of St.
Bernard. One also sees, close by, a circle of
large stones marking the spot where Hannibal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
is supposed to have held a council of war.
A simple slab by the roadside designates the
boundary line between Italy and France.
As if to emphasize the fact that we were in
France, a group of French soldiers were on
duty close to the frontier. The cuisine of the
restaurant Belvedere, with its attractive <i>carte
du jour</i>, took us into the real atmosphere of
the country.</p>

<p>The descent of nearly eighteen miles from
the summit to the French <i>douane</i> at Séez, was
like passing from mid-winter to mid-summer.
What a superb stretch of motoring it was!
The panorama, one of those marvelous masterpieces
which nature rarely spreads before
the eyes even of fortunate motorists! From
our point of observation, on a level with the ice
peaks, we could look for miles down into the
plains of Savoy. Mont Blanc glistened like
burnished silver. We could trace the mountain
streams from their cradle in the glacier to
their wild leaping from cascade to cascade
and to the more peaceful flow through the
valley. Pine forests mantled the lower part
of the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Ignition was cut off, and the car left to
her own momentum. The grades were much
steeper than on the Italian slope, and the
curves without railing or protection of any
kind. The slightest carelessness in steering
would have been fatal. Flowers and grass
began to cover the meadows. Pine forests
surrounded us. Then we entered on the long,
sharp descent to Séez, stopping at the <i>douane</i>
where the French officials came out to receive
us.</p>

<p>The following incident will sound almost too
incredible even to be included in a story of
motor experiences. There was a small duty
to be paid on the gasoline which we were
carrying. Our wealth consisted of American
express checks, a few Italian coins, and some
French change, insufficient by twenty <i>centimes</i>
to pay the duty. One of the officials advanced
the twenty <i>centimes</i> from his own pocket, thus
saving us the inconvenience of trying to cash
the express checks somewhere in the town.
We wished to "snap" his picture, but his
modesty was too great. He also refused the
Italian coins which we tried to press upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
him as a souvenir of the occasion. One
associates customhouse officials with so many
things that are unpleasant, that the incident
naturally made a great impression on us.</p>

<p>Our difficulties were by no means over.
The winding road with its sharp grades required
the greatest caution. Near the Pont
St. Martin it appeared to run straight over a
precipice, and then turned sharply to the right.
This was the place where only a few weeks
later an American party suffered a terrible
accident. Their machine swerved while making
the slippery turn, and fell nearly seventy
feet among the rocks.</p>

<p>For a distance of seventeen miles from Bourg
St. Maurice to Mouthiers the road was in
an appalling condition, any speed over ten
miles an hour being at the risk of breaking
the springs. A railroad was being constructed,
and the heavy teams had raised havoc. We
were creeping through this traffic, when the
sudden halt of the wagon in front compelled
us to stop. Two big teams, drawing stone,
closed in on either side. The drivers, intent
only on looking ahead, did not notice that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
their heavy wheels were in danger of smashing
the car. We finally attracted their attention,
but barely in time to avoid trouble. From
Albertville our course was over the splendid
Nationale, which runs from Paris to Italy.</p>

<p>It is always a pleasant experience to motor
on these famous highways, to observe the
governmental system of tree planting, and
to study what trees have been found most
suitable in certain regions to protect the road
and the traveler. The ornamental horse chestnut
and maple greeted us most often in the
small towns of eastern and northern France.
Long rows of plane trees formed one of the
familiar and beautiful sights of Provençe. We
often saw these trees fringing the fields to
give shelter and protection from the blasts
of the mistral. It was also interesting to
notice how fruit trees have in many places
replaced forest trees along the road. These
national highways, so much improved by
Napoleon, were for us like open books for the
study of the French trees.</p>

<p>It has been well noted that "while the state
has the right to plant along the national roads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
at any distance it pleases from the adjoining
property, it exercises this right with judicious
moderation and leaves, as a rule, two meters&mdash;six
and one-half feet&mdash;between the trees and
the outside edge of the roadway.</p>

<p>"Tree planting is let in small contracts,
sometimes as low as five thousand francs apiece.
The object of this is to promote competition
and to attract specialists, such as gardeners
and nurserymen, who are hardly likely to have
the means for undertaking large contracts.</p>

<p>"Government inspectors see that the contractor
plants well-formed trees, free from disease
and in every way first class.</p>

<p>"As the best planting season is short, a fine
is imposed for every day's delay. When the
contractor gets his pay, a certain sum is retained
as a guarantee; and for two years he is
responsible for the care of the trees and for the
replacing of any that died or that proved defective.
The sum held back until the final
acceptance of his work, protects the government
from danger of loss."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>There was no hurry about reaching Chambéry,
our headquarters for the night. The
distance of a few miles could easily be covered
before dark, so we halted for a little while by
the roadside. The car was in remarkably good
condition after the tremendous strain of the
day's ride. Dimly, in the distance, towered
the snow-clad heights where we had been motoring
only a short time before. By thus tarrying
a while we enjoyed dazzling retrospect,
present beauty, and alluring prospect.</p>

<p>A big Peugot tore by. These wide, smooth
highways of crushed stone invite speed. There
is a speed limit of eighteen miles in the open
country, but it has long been a dead letter.
The French system is to allow the motorist to
choose his own pace, but to make him fully
responsible for accidents. By thus heavily
penalizing careless driving, the law works to
develop the driver's discretion and does not
impose farcical speed limits. This absence of
burdensome regulations eliminates an endless
amount of friction, and is one of many conditions
in France which have contributed to
the pleasure and comfort of foreign motorists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Now we were in Savoy, celebrated for its
mountain scenery, its lakes, and curious peasant
villages. There was a home feeling in our
return to this beautiful French province, for
we had motored here a previous summer.
Many a delightful motor ramble was associated
with the names of Chamonix, at the foot of
Mont Blanc; Evian-les-Bains, on Lake Geneva;
Annecy, on the lake of the same name, that
quaint city which so charmed the Prince of
Wales, a few years ago, with its arcaded, winding
streets and old-world charm; Aix-les-Bains,
the noted and popular watering place; and
there, only a few miles away, Chambéry,
historic city of the dukes of Savoy and of the
kings of Italy. It was fine to see that same blue
atmosphere about us again, and, above all, to
think that for weeks our motor wanderings
were to be in France, the one country on the
continent of Europe where an American can
feel most at home, and where the motorist can
find, amid diversity of scenery, a provincial life
charming alike for its hospitality and old-fashioned
customs. Riding through the twilight
to Chambéry, we hunted up the Hôtel de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
France. This hotel could hardly have been
described as luxurious, but it was comfortable,
as are most of the hotels in the provinces.</p>

<p>The chief interest of Chambéry centers about
the Rue des Arcades. At one end of the
arcaded street is the curious Fontaine des
Elephants. This monument, on four bronze
elephants, is dedicated "to the Comte de
Boigne, who settled here after his romantic life
of soldiering in India and bestowed much of the
fruit of the pagoda-tree upon the town." At
the other end of the street are the high, massive
walls which protect the château where the dukes
of Savoy lived and where some of the kings
of Italy were born. There is little enough to
recall the glamour and glitter of those proud
days. The city, with its more prosaic emblems
of civil and military authority, now occupies
the château.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
A VISIT TO LYONS</h2>


<p>At Chambéry we interrupted our trip
through southern France to visit Lyons,
the center of the silk industry not only for
France but for the entire world. For once, we
traveled by train. There is an element of strain
about mountain motoring which is as severe
upon driver as upon car. A diversion is not
only welcome but almost necessary to the
motorist who has twice guided his car over the
Alps within the short space of a few days.
The exhilaration of looking down into France
or Italy from the summit of the Alps does not
lessen the dangers of the long descent, where for
considerable stretches every foot of the way is
crowded with possibilities of accident.</p>

<p>Lyons, while usually overlooked by the vast
army of summer tourists, holds, in many
respects, a unique place among the world's great
cities. We would speak of its magnificent location
upon two rivers, the rapid Rhone and the
sluggish Saône; of the twenty-seven bridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
that cross them; of the many miles of tree-lined
quays, which hold back the spring floods and
offer a lovely promenade to the people. No one
who has seen Lyons will forget how the houses
rise in picturesque confusion, tier piled above
tier, to the heights of Fauvière, where some of
the Roman emperors lived centuries ago, and
where, on the site of the old Roman forum,
stands a beautiful church, overlooking the city
and embracing one of the views of Europe of
which one never tires. On a clear day the Alps
are visible, and the snows of Mont Blanc, and
just outside the city one can see the two rivers
uniting in their sweep to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Lyons is a military stronghold. Its prominence
as a manufacturing and railroad center
indicates, of course, its great strategic importance.
Seventeen forts guard the hills around
the city. The army is much in evidence.
This constant coming and going of the French
soldiers gives much color and animation to the
street scenes. Everyone is impressed by the
cuirassiers. They are powerfully built and
look so effective, like real soldiers who could
uphold the traditions of Napoleon's time, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>who would feel much more at home on the battle
field than at an afternoon tea. We saw the
Zouaves, in their huge, baggy red <i>pantalons</i>
and with their faces tanned by exposure to the
tropical sun of Algeria. Their red caps reminded
us of the Turkish fez.</p>

<p>The Place des Terraux, peaceful enough
to-day with its busy shops and clouds of white
doves, witnessed many a tragic spectacle of the
French Revolution. The guillotine stood in
the center of the square. Lyons, always
royalist in its sympathies, was one of the first
cities to raise the standard of revolt against the
excesses of the revolutionists in Paris. The
consequences of this act were fatal and terrible.
The Reign of Terror in Paris was surpassed by
the more gruesome reign of terror in Lyons.
An army was sent against the city, which was
finally captured, after a desperate resistance.
"Then the convention resolved to inflict an
unheard-of punishment; it ordered the destruction
of a part of the city and the erection on the
ruins of a pillar, with the inscription, 'Lyons
waged war with liberty; Lyons is no more.'"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>The city was "the scene of perhaps the greatest
cruelty of the Revolution, when women who
had begged for mercy to their dear ones, were
tied to the foot of the guillotine and compelled
to witness hours of butchery."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It was soon
found that the guillotine did not work fast
enough. The defect was quickly remedied.
Hundreds of captives were taken outside the
city, where the guns of the revolutionists continued
the slaughter on a larger and more satisfactory
scale.</p>

<p>Possibly the most interesting fact about
modern Lyons is its industrial prominence.
Baedeker tells us that the city exports annually
over one hundred million dollars' worth of silk.
Its life seems to be founded upon this one industry.
The rich Lyonnais are silk manufacturers.
The museum of silks is the finest thing of its
kind in Europe. In the old part of the city is
the statue of Jacquard, the inventor of the silk
loom. As we walked through the narrow
streets, there could be heard the sharp clicking
of the shuttles, a sign that the weavers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
busy at their looms. We were shown the
"conditioning house," where the imported raw
silk is tested and subjected to a high temperature.
This is the first important step in the
manufacture of silk, which in the raw state
absorbs moisture readily. But by exposing the
silk to heat at a temperature of seventy-two to
seventy-seven degrees Fahrenheit, the water
evaporates and the weight of the silk may then
be ascertained. To prevent fraud it is then
marked by a sworn valuer. France raises very
little raw silk, most of it being imported from
Japan and China. Out of a population of
nearly half a million, nearly a third is directly
engaged in the production of silk, and the
workers in the surrounding districts would
probably number as many more. For a distance
of thirty miles, outside of Lyons, the
country is dotted with little houses, each containing
one or more looms. The prosperity of
few large cities is more clearly the result of a
single industry.</p>

<p>Americans are especially interested in Lyons
for its connection with the starting of silk manufacturing
in the United States. A short time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
ago we were shown a letter written in 1863 by
an American living in Lyons. He refers to the
excitement created in this district by the
rumor that weavers were being engaged with a
view to establishing silk manufacturing in the
United States on a very extensive scale, and
that several companies had been formed and
had sent out agents to purchase in Lyons all the
machinery and looms used in the manufacture
of silk. The writer doubted if the conditions in
the United States would make possible the success
of the venture. In spite of this prediction,
the industry developed rapidly, so that to-day
nine hundred American manufacturers have a
combined annual output valued at over two
hundred million dollars. At the time of the
assassination of Lincoln the United States government
received a silk flag from the weavers
of Lyons dedicated to the people of the United
States in memory of Abraham Lincoln. The
flag was of the finest fabric and was inscribed:
"Popular subscription to the Republic of the
United States, in memory of Abraham Lincoln.
Lyons, 1865."</p>

<p>But while the United States is making more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
silk than France, Lyons remains the real center
and heart of the industry. American high-power
looms are mostly engaged in turning out,
by the mile, a cheaper kind of silk, and largely
confined to standard grades in most common
use. The thread is much coarser. After having
lived in Lyons it is possible to understand
why this city continues to be the center of the
silk industry, even when we consider that this
is a mechanical age, and that the inventions of
one nation spread quickly to competing nations.
American manufacturers are using the
Jacquard loom, a Lyonnais invention. The
first American looms were imported from Lyons,
but one thing which was not bought and imported
with the loom, was that aptitude for
handling it which is inborn in the Lyonnais.
Machinery has its limitations, and back of the
machine is the question of efficient labor. The
trained hand of the workman is needed at every
turn. The looms of Lyons are famous for their
light, soft, brilliant tissues. The silk thread
woven into many of these beautiful products is
so fine that two and one-half million feet of it
would weigh only two and one-fifth pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>It is an experience to see the weavers at their
work, and to watch the sure, skillful way in
which they weave the thousands of delicate
threads into harmonies of color. Their skill is
the heritage that has come down from father to
son. These workmen have a start of many
centuries over their American competitors.
Their ancestors were weaving silk before America
was discovered, the industry being started
in Lyons in 1450 by Italian refugees. Traditions
count for a great deal in the silk industry,
and from the moment when Lyonnais
weavers gained the Grand Prix from their
Venetian rivals, under Louis XIV, in the latter
half of the seventeenth century, their looms
were busy making costly robes and rare
tapestries for the royalty of Europe. In the
museum at Lyons is a robe worn by the famous
Catherine II of Russia. One is shown tapestries
that adorned the apartments of Marie Antoinette
in the Tuileries at Paris, and the throne
room of Napoleon I in the palace at Versailles.
Money could not buy these precious souvenirs
of the Lyonnais looms. Many of the gorgeous
robes worn at the coronation ceremony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
George V were made in Lyons. To-day, as in
the past, to make these rich silks and brocades
that France is exporting, there is needed not
only the skill of the worker, but the soul of the
artist. This artistic French temperament is
the important and deciding factor that makes
Lyons the center of the silk industry. There
has been the attempt to create in the United
States a style which would be distinctly
American. It failed. The German emperor
also encouraged efforts to create a style which
would be typically German. The result was
the same. The atmosphere in these countries
is too commercial and mechanical for artistic
vitality. In such an environment it is said that
the French weavers who are employed in American
silk factories become less effective, and lose
much of their artistic originality. The industrial
pace is too fast. The cost of labor in the
United States is so great that the emphasis has
to be placed on speed and quantity in order to
cover the cost of production. But in Lyons,
with a cheaper labor cost, the organization of
hand and power looms is so perfect that a manufacturer
is able to fill large orders readily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>A superior loom organization, combined with
a temperament naturally artistic and creative,
explains the advantage of the Lyonnais manufacturer
over his American rival, and why it is
that American buyers for our large department
stores come to Lyons twice a year to select
designs and place orders with the Lyonnais
manufacturers. Department stores which cater
to the wealthiest class of trade have their representatives
permanently stationed here to
keep in closest possible touch with the latest
French fashions.</p>

<p>This question of style is of such absorbing
interest to the average American home that it
will be worth while to notice the forces at work
in Lyons to produce it. Paris is so largely the
parade ground for new fashions that nearly
everyone overlooks the tremendous influence
of Lyons in the creation of styles. The hundred
and more silk manufacturers of Lyons
have their own designers, who are constantly
devising new patterns and color combinations.
Most of the new designs and color schemes that
appear every season in muslins, taffetas, satins,
in all the varied kinds and qualities of silk, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
their origin here. This is the creative source.
It is Paris that discriminates and decides to
which of these new patterns it will give expression
in the models which will be copied in all
the fashion centers of the world. Paris has the
artistic sense of knowing how to combine the
materials that Lyons furnishes. The two cities
work together. The famous fashion stores of
Paris and the silk manufacturers of Lyons are
the primary factors in the creation of styles, and
yet, after all, the origin of style is to be found in
the spirit of the times. Our restless age craves
constant change. A century ago in France,
when life moved more slowly, the silk dress was
an important part of the bride's trousseau, and
after being worn on special occasions through
her life, was handed down to the next generation.
But to-day the styles change with the
seasons.</p>

<p>And as they change in Paris so they change
in the United States. If we look at this question
of style simply from the standpoint of
organization, it seems remarkable how perfectly
every little detail of the complicated
machinery has been worked out. A French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
silk manufacturer, who arrived in Lyons after a
visit to several American cities, was impressed
not only with the rapidity with which styles
spread from the upper to the middle classes,
and the quickness with which the American
people grasp new ideas of dress, but also with
the fact that Paris fashions appear in New York
and Chicago at almost the same time that they
appear in Paris. He saw accurate reproductions
of the spring Paris fashions, made in
America of French materials, and with the
color, the line, the idea, the detail, so perfectly
reproduced that it would have been difficult to
decide between them and the Paris garment.
More and more we are coming to realize our
great debt to France, and to the Old World, for
our education in matters of taste, for our
appreciation of beauty in line and color.</p>

<p>And in Lyons one comes closest to this artistic
spirit in the workshops of the weavers, and
especially those who work on the hand looms.
There are thousands of these weavers of the old
school that has done so much to make famous
the silk industry of the city. Their wages are
small and they work amid surroundings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
extreme poverty. We visited some of them in
their shops. Often we found the loom situated
in a damp, gloomy basement, or on the top
floor of some old house that looked as though it
might have passed through the storm and stress
of the period of the French Revolution. These
sanitary conditions are so bad that in 1911
there was organized a charitable company with
the sole purpose of providing decent lodgings
where the weavers could work under improved
conditions of light and shade. We always
found them hospitable, eager to exhibit their
work and explain the workings of the loom. In
one workshop the weaver was busy with a piece
of satin, the design being wrought in silver and
gold. For this beautiful bit of tapestry, which
had been ordered for one of the apartments of
the Queen of England in Windsor Castle, the
workman was receiving only one dollar a day.
On another loom there was being reproduced a
piece of sixteenth-century brocade. A French
millionaire had noticed the original in a museum
and wanted an exact reproduction of it
for a new château he is building. After a
morning passed amid such scenes, you feel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Lyons is worth visiting, if for no other reason
than to see at their work these artists of the
loom who are so closely associated with one
of the world's oldest and most interesting
industries.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
CHAMBÉRY TO NÎMES</h2>


<p>From Chambéry our course ran southwest
through the Midi, that great sweep of
territory stretching across the Mediterranean
basin from the Alps to the Pyrenees and
embracing many of the most interesting regions
in France.</p>

<p>Our departure, early in the afternoon, was
under somber skies. We were just reaching
the outskirts of the city when the engine gave
evidence of trouble. The car ran for a little
way and then stopped. An investigation revealed
the necessity of cleaning the spark
plugs. While engaged in this work, we did
not notice the approach of an ox team which
came swinging along the road, drawing a
two-wheeled cart, the wheels high and heavy,
of a type which one often sees in the Midi.
We were bending over the engine, with no
thought of impending danger, when, without
warning, the great wheels were upon us.
The driver was evidently asleep; it was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
late to attract his attention. The wheel
grazed one of us, and then, as the oxen swung
in, crushed the other against the fender. It
was fortunate that the fender yielded just
enough to cause him to be forced under it
and thus saved him from serious injury. Our
car carried the scars of that encounter until
the end of the trip. We were just as well
satisfied that it was the car which bore the
scars.</p>

<p>Not more than a mile or so from the scene
of this adventure, a sign called attention to
a long tunnel just ahead. The signs of the
French roads speak an expressive language,
they are so elaborately worked out for the
traveler's convenience. This time it was a
voice of warning. Lamps were lighted. The
tunnel closed over us. We could just make
out the faint star of daylight ahead. Weird
shadows danced in front of the car. In the
silence and gloom, the noise of our progress
over the slippery road was greatly magnified.
We emerged from the tunnel to find ourselves
above a broad valley and nearing the small
town of Les Echelles.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Until this point our course was the route
to the Grande Chartreuse, the monastery
where, in mediæval days, the monks concocted
a soothing cordial to refresh the hours of rude
toil. The road now branched off in another
direction. Our hopes of catching a glimpse
of the celebrated old monastery, built high
amid enshrining mountains, were doomed to
disappointment. A storm was about to break.
Heavy clouds, weighted down by their burdens
of water, blotted out everything. From a
patch of blue sky above Les Echelles, the
sun streamed, and then disappeared. We
raced down the easy slope to gain shelter in
the village a mile away. Swiftly the thick
curtain of rain closed in. It was a question
whether we would be able to reach shelter
before the fury of the elements burst upon us.
Once more our car proved equal to the emergency,
and we poked our way into the shed
adjoining a village inn and waited until the
worst of the storm had subsided. The rain
continuing, we put up the top, and started
in time to see a brilliant rainbow arching the
whole valley. It was only for a moment. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the rest of the afternoon we splashed steadily
through puddles and mud.</p>

<p>The scenery changed. Mountain landscapes
gave place to the lowlands of the Midi, barren
rocks to fertile peasant farms. It was all a
glimpse of France as she really is; not like
Germany, a land of large cities, but rather
of small towns and rural hamlets where peasant
ownership is a fact, and where the peasantry
form a mighty political force. France, so
torn by rival factions, would be like a machine
without a balance wheel if it were not for a
large peasant class attached to the soil by the
bond of ownership. The life of the French
peasant is not easy. He toils long hours for
small rewards. Even in the rain, we could
see him continuing at his work. But he is
free. Those two or three acres are his own.
That is the great point. This fact of possession,
by creating local ties and by fostering
patriotism, is the safeguard of the country.
His implements appeared to be of the simplest;
probably most of those whom we saw working
on that rainy afternoon had never seen a
steam plow or a harvesting machine. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
homes were equally rude. Everywhere in
France we noticed the absence of those cozy,
comfortable houses which are so characteristic
of the average American farm. Few fences
were to be seen, possibly because of the spirit
of justice as regards property rights, or perhaps
because the land laws had been so perfectly
worked out.</p>

<p>We entered Romans through a street so
unusually wide as to be a pleasant surprise.
Darkness was coming on. Road signs were
indistinct, so we were forced to inquire the
way to Valence. The people were obliging.
Whether we were in the country or in some
small town, there was always in evidence that
same spirit of hospitable helpfulness which
we found at the French <i>douane</i> in Séez.</p>

<p>The street lamps of Valence were burning
when we arrived at the Hôtel de la Croix d'Or,
so well known to all who journey from Paris
to the Riviera. The marble entrance was
quite imposing, but apparently after reaching
the top of the staircase the builders were
suddenly seized by a passion for economy,
since the interior was very plain, like most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of the hotels in the French provincial towns.
The dinner, however, made up for other
deficiencies. Here, and all through the
Midi, we could be sure of delicious <i>haricots
verts</i>, <i>omelette</i>, and <i>poulet</i>; and what may seem
strange, we never became tired of these
dishes. The art of cooking them must be a
monopoly of the French cuisine, for they never
tasted so good in other countries.</p>

<p>Valence is more of a place to stop <i>en tour</i>
than to visit for sight-seeing. It is fortunate
in being situated on the main route from Paris
to the Riviera, the road that we were to follow,
and probably the most popular and most
frequented motor road in France. Over its
smooth, broad surface passes the winter rush
of motorists seeking the warmer, more congenial
climate of the Mediterranean shores.</p>

<p>We often found more or less trouble in getting
out of the larger French towns. The streets
are apt to have a snarl and tangle. Carts
and wagons block the way. Roads are the
worse for wear. This seemed to us one of the
big differences between France and Germany.
The German town is neat, clean, well-kept as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
if the watchful eye of municipal authority
were always on the alert to notice and remedy
small defects. The average French town looks
neglected. The people are just as thrifty, but
they appear to care less for appearances.</p>

<p>From Valence we swung more quickly than
usual into the splendid Route Nationale
above mentioned. It was Sunday. Peasants
were entering and coming from the small
age-worn churches. At that hour the fields
looked strangely deserted. Blue skies were
radiant, the air agreeably cooled by the rain
of the night before, the dust well laid. More
and more we were yielding to the fascination
of Europe from a motor car. Train schedules
did not trouble us. We were independent.
There were no worries about having to arrive
or depart at a certain hour. Life on the road
was a constant flow of new impressions, new
experiences. Every village had its own unique
attraction. Many motor cars passed us, each
one an object of interest. Possibly in our
cruise along these high seas of the French
roads our feelings were a little like those of
the mariner when he sights a passing ship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Where does she hail from? Where her probable
destination? Of what make? What flag
is she flying? It was always a welcome sight
to view the Stars and Stripes flying toward us.
One can usually tell the American car even
when some distance away, it is built so high.
We noticed many Fords and Cadillacs. There
is not much of a market in Europe for the
expensive American car, because the foreign
high-priced car is considered by the Europeans
to be good enough. The cheaper American
product has a market because few of the foreign
firms make a cheap car.</p>

<p>High noon was upon us, the heat oppressive,
our appetites ravenous, when we stopped in
the poor little village of Pierrelatte. The
prospect for lunch was not encouraging. A
single stray resident appeared at the other
end of the silent street. The houses might
have been occupied by peasants who wrested
mere existence from a barren soil. The inn,
which was pointed out to us, would never
have been recognized as such. It looked more
like a venerable ruin. In an American town
of this size we would have hesitated before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>entering, and then probably would have turned
away in despair to look for a bakery shop to
stay the pangs of hunger. But we were growing
familiar with the small French towns.
It does not take long to discover that a hotel
with an exterior symbolizing woe and want
can have a very attractive interior at lunch
time.</p>

</div>

<p>We are still carrying pleasant memories of
that lunch. There was <i>potage St. Germain</i>,
made as only the French can make it. The
oil for the <i>salade</i> was from the neighboring
olive groves of Provençe. The <i>haricots verts</i>
picked that morning in the garden, the <i>raisins</i>
fresh from the vineyard. Best of all were
the mushroom patties. One portion called
for another. Our hostess was pleased; there
was no mistaking our genuine appreciation
of her cooking. Interrupting her culinary
labors, she told us that the mushrooms were
of her own canning. Each year it was necessary
to lay in a larger supply. Tourists had
found them so good that, on leaving, they had
left orders for shipment to their home addresses.
Now she was planning to erect a small factory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Her recital was interrupted by a Frenchman,
who implored "<i>une troisième portion</i>." He
purchased a dozen cans of mushrooms, and if
they had been gold nuggets he could not have
stowed them away more carefully in his car.
The French are authorities when it is a question
of good things to eat.</p>

<p>The road to Orange was like a continuous
leafy arbor. This shimmering arcade was too
refreshingly cool to be covered quickly. On
the outskirts of Orange we halted to see the
Arc de Triomphe, a wonderful echo from the
age of Tiberius. The arch stands in a circular
grassy plot and the road divides, as if this
product of the Roman mind were too precious
to be exposed to the accidents of ordinary
traffic.</p>

<p>The antique theater at the other end of the
town is just as remarkable for architectural
splendor. It is not enough to say that this
structure is the largest and most magnificent
of its kind in the world. It is also the best
preserved. Every year in August dramatic
and lyrical performances are given by <i>La
Comédie Française</i>. Thus, after nearly twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>centuries, the theater is still serving its original
purpose. We were impressed by the auditory
facilities. One of us stood on the lowest tier
of seats, and the other on the topmost row.
Even a whisper was distinctly audible. The
erection of buildings with such perfect acoustics
may perhaps be classed among the lost arts.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p  class="center"><i>Arc de Triomphe at Orange</i></p>
<p class="center">Copyright by Underwood &amp; Underwood</p></div>
</div>

<p>Southward from Orange, the country began
to look more like Italy. Olive and mulberry
trees were more numerous. The cypress trees,
so often seen in Italian cemeteries, gave an
impression of solemnity, almost of melancholy,
to the country. At times they fringed the
highway or stood alone upon the horizon
like a distant steeple against a crimson sunset.</p>

<p>The twilight was full of a brooding, dreamy
silence as of communion with the past. This
is the atmosphere of Provençe, an atmosphere
of "old, forgotten, far-off things and battles
long ago." If one is interested in wonderful
ruins that suggest the might of Rome's empire,
then let him go to Provençe, that part of
southern France where the Romans founded
their <i>provincia</i>, and where they built great
cities. We found the hotels rather dreary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
The towns were quiet. Many of them, like
Pierrelatte, looked so poor. The streets were
dirty and littered. One notices these things
at first, and then forgets them, the air is so
clear, the sunshine so dazzling, the horizons
so distinct, the stars so bright.</p>

<p>Much of the country is barren and rocky.
But the rocks as well as the ruins have a rich,
golden brown color from being steeped for
centuries in this bright southern sun. The
people are romantic, impractical, happy in
their poverty, singing amid grinding routine.
They have their own dialect, which is very
musical. Even the names of their towns and
cities are full of music, for example, Montélimar,
Avignon, Carcassonne. The country,
with its Roman ruins, its bright sun, its rich
color, its laughter, and song, is like another
Italy. Nowhere except in that land do we
come so close to the great things of Roman
antiquity.</p>

<p>We reached the Grand Hôtel in Avignon
at nightfall, but dined outside that we might
the better observe the life of the people. The
sweet voice of an Italian street singer made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>it easy for us to imagine ourselves under the
skies of Florence or Naples. Avignon is the
most Italian looking city in France.</p>

</div>

<p>The following morning was devoted to
rambling. Sometime we must spend a week
in this interesting walled city on the Rhone,
where the popes lived between 1305 and 1377
in the huge palace that resembles a fortress.
If there were nothing to Avignon but its high
mediæval walls and watch towers, the place
would be worth a long pilgrimage. These
gray ramparts, apparently new, were actually
built in the fourteenth century. What a picture
they gave us of stormy feudal times, when
even the Church was compelled to seek safety
behind strong walls!</p>

<p>The Palais des Papes is a colossal structure.
We have forgotten what pope it was who was
besieged here for years by a French army, and
then escaped by the postern; it does not
matter. The palace walls looked high and
thick enough to defy all attack. The scenes
of vice and profligacy during this period must
have rivaled the court life of an ancient Roman
emperor. There was one pope, John XXII,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
who in eighteen years amassed a fortune of
eighteen million gold florins in specie, not to
mention the trifling sum of seven millions in
plate and jewels. Perhaps it was just as well
for the popes of that time that the walls of
their fortress towers were high and thick.</p>

<p>Above the palace of the popes and the adjoining
cathedral is the Promenade des Doms, a
public garden. We followed one of the paths
that led along the edge of a high precipice.
This view is one of the sights of Avignon. It
embraces the valley of the Rhone, the swiftest
river in France. The rapid current winds and
disappears. Nearly opposite, on the other
shore, is the village of Villeneuve. It is desolate
enough now, with no trace of the beautiful
villas which the cardinals built and where they
were wont to revel amid luxury after the day's
duties at the palace. Beyond the town we
could see the stately towers of Fort St. André,
in that early period a frontier fortress of France,
so jealous of the growing power of the papacy.
Most appealing of all, was the broken bridge of
St. Benezet, resisting with its few remaining
arches the hastening Rhone. Above one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>piers is the little Chapel of St. Nicholas. The
bridge is a romantic relic of the gay life of
Avignon when the city was the refuge of the
popes. Daudet, in his <i>Lettres de mon Moulin</i>,
tells us that the streets were too narrow for the
<i>farandole</i>, so the people would place the pipes
and tambourine on the bridge and there, in the
fresh wind of the Rhone, they would dance and
sing.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The distance to Nîmes was so short that we
decided to motor there for lunch, see the vast
Roman amphitheater and the world-famous
Maison Carrée, and then push on to Montpellier,
where we planned to spend the night and
perhaps remain for a day or so.</p>

<p>The ride was more memorable for the
oppressive heat than for any particular charm
of scenery. It was noon when we crossed the
river and looked back for a last view of the
huge Palais des Papes. The sun blazed upon
the white road, which quivered like white heat.
There were few trees. The engine hood was so
hot that we could not touch it. It would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
have surprised us if one tire, or all of them, had
burst; they probably would have done so if we
had gone much farther. The glare was so
intense that we entirely overlooked the little
<i>octroi</i> station on the edge of the town. We, however,
were not overlooked. Some one was shouting
and waving a hundred yards behind us. It
was not inspiring to back slowly through our
own dust to convey the valuable information
that we carried nothing dutiable. Of course, at
a time like this, the engine refused to start.
After vigorously "cranking" for a quarter of an
hour, and suffering all the sensations of sunstroke,
we moved on to the Hôtel du Luxembourg
for <i>déjeuner</i>.</p>

<p>Among our recollections of the lunch at this
hotel were the ripe, purple figs. There is no
reason why we should confess how quickly this
delicious fruit disappeared. Farther north, in
Berlin, such figs would have been a luxury, and
might have appeared for sale at a fancy price in
some store window. In Nîmes they were served
as a regular part of the lunch. We could almost
have traced our trip southward by the fruits
that were served us from time to time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>The broad boulevards and shady avenues of
Nîmes form a small part of the attractions of
this prosperous city. There are fine theaters
and cafés, especially the cafés with tables and
chairs extending into the streets to accommodate
the crowds of thirsty patrons. It was
pleasant to be a part of this typically French
environment, to watch this group or that, with
their gestures, shrugging of shoulders, laughter,
and rapid conversation. Many phases of
French life pass before so advantageous an
observation point.</p>

<p>But Nîmes is not simply a modern city. Nowhere
else in France, not even in Orange, does
one get a clearer idea of what the splendor of
Roman civilization must have been. <i>Provincia</i>
was a favorite and favored province of the
empire; Nîmes was the center of provincial life.
For five centuries the different emperors took
turns in enriching and embellishing it. We
visited the Maison Carrée, most perfect of
existing Roman temples, inspected the gateway
called the Porte d'Auguste, looked up at the
Tour Magne, a Roman tower, saw the remains
of the Roman baths, and then made our way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the amphitheater, smaller than the Colosseum
but so wonderfully preserved that you simply
lose track of the centuries. The great stones,
fitting so evenly without cement, have that
same rich, golden brown color, the prevailing
color tone of Provençe. We entered the amphitheater
through one of many arcades, the same
arcades through which so many generations of
toga-clad Romans had passed to applaud the
gladiatorial combats. Now the people go there
to see the bull fights which are held three or
four times a year. On that particular afternoon
a large platform had been erected for the
orchestra in the middle of the arena. Open-air
concerts are very popular in Nîmes during
the summer.</p>

<p>It was something of a shock to pass from
these scenes of Roman life by a jump into a
motor car&mdash;the amphitheater illustrating the
grandeur of Rome's once imperial sway, the
motor car symbolizing the spirit of our rushing
modern age. The contrast was startling.</p>

NÎMES TO CARCASSONNE</h2>


<p>There was abundance of time to arrive in
Montpellier before dark, so we let the
speedometer waver between thirty and thirty-five
kilometers. The road was hardly a model
of smoothness. We were not always enthusiastic
about the roads in the Midi. On the whole,
they were not much more than average, and
not so good as we had expected to find them
after that first experience on the Route Nationale
to Chambéry. Where there was a bad
place in the road we usually saw a pile of loose
stones waiting to be used for repair, but many
of these piles looked as though they had been
waiting a long time. The roads are apparently
allowed to go too long before receiving attention.
Owing to the increasing amount of heavy
traffic, the deterioration in recent years has
been more rapid than formerly. In some of the
provinces, like Touraine, there were short
stretches of roadway in urgent need of repair.
With conditions as they now are, the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
voted by the government is insufficient to keep
up the standard of former years. England now
expends more than twice as much per mile as
France, but while the French roads are in danger
of losing to England the supremacy they
have so long enjoyed, we cannot state too clearly
that, taken as a whole, they are still the finest
on the Continent. It is probable that the present
signs of decadence are only temporary.
The government is fully alive to the needs of the
hour. In all probability the movement headed
by President Poincaré more fully to open up
the provinces to motor-tourist travel will have
a good effect upon road conditions.</p>

<p>It would be hard to find a small French city
which makes such a pleasant first impression as
Montpellier; there is such an atmosphere of
culture. One does not need to be told that this
is a university town. Municipal affairs seem to
be well regulated; the <i>hôtel de ville</i> would do
credit to a much larger city. We discovered an
open-air restaurant located upon an attractive
<i>place</i>. The <i>garçon</i>, after receiving a preliminary
<i>pourboire</i>, served us so well that we returned
there the next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Everybody who visits Montpellier will remember
the Promenade de Peyrou which rises
above the town. The scenic display is great.
Only a few miles away, and in clear view, tosses
the restless Mediterranean. The prospect made
us realize how far south we had come since the
starting of our tour from Berlin. Another interesting
bit of sight-seeing in the neighborhood
is the Jardin des Plantes, a remarkable
botanical garden which was founded as far back
as 1593 by Henry IV, and is said to be the
oldest in France.</p>

<p>Whatever the indictment against French
roads in the Midi, the stretch from Montpellier
to Carcassonne was above reproach. Much of
the way it was the French highway at its best.
Wide-spreading trees arched our route. We
would have been speeding every foot of the distance
if the beautiful scenery had not acted as a
constant brake. For a little way we ran close
to the sea. The fresh salt breeze fanned our
faces. It was a rare glimpse of the Mediterranean.
This enchanting scene lasted but a
moment, for the road swerved into the great
vineyards of the Midi, an Arcadian land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
peace and plenty, the home of a wine industry
celebrated since Roman times. As far as the
eye could reach, nothing but these green waves
that billowed and rolled away from either side
of the road. There was a touch of fall in the
air, a glint of purple amid the green. Ripening
suns and tender rains had done their work.
The road led through Béziers, bustling center of
preparations for the harvest. On several occasions
we passed a wagon loaded with wine casks
so large that three horses with difficulty drew it.
The capacity of those huge casks must have been
thousands of gallons.</p>

<p>At Béziers we could have taken the direct
route to Toulouse, but then we would have
missed seeing Carcassonne, the most unique
architectural curiosity in France and perhaps
in the whole world. Our roundabout course
brought us to Capestang, a scattered peasant
village inhabited by laborers in the vineyards.
The luxuries and even the ordinary conveniences
seemed far away from these homes. The
shutters consisted of nothing but a couple of
boards bolted or nailed together and clumsily
working on a hinge. It was a region of flies;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
certainly they had invaded the little inn where
we lunched. A heavy green matting tried
ineffectually to take the place of a screen door,
and let in thousands of unbidden guests.
Under these circumstances our lunch was a
hasty one. As the noontide heat was too great
to permit a start, we gladly accepted the invitation
of our <i>hôtesse</i> to see the church. The
cool interior induced us to prolong our acquaintance
with the sacred relics and to admire with
our guide a statue of St. Peter whose halo had
become somewhat dimmed by the dust of
centuries.</p>

<p>The afternoon's ride to Carcassonne was in
the face of a strong wind. It was our first
experience with the mistral, a curious and
disagreeable phenomenon of Provençe. There
was no let-up to the storms of dust it swept
over us. There were no clouds; simply this
incessant wind that hurled its invisible forces
against the car, at times with such violence
that we were almost standing still. A heavy
rainstorm would have been preferable; at
least we would not then have been so blinded
by the dust. Occasionally the shelter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
high hills gave a brief respite from the choking
gusts.</p>

<p>All at once we forgot about the wind. In
full view from the road was a hill crowned
by the towers and ramparts of a mediæval
city, a marvelous maze of battlements, frowning
and formidable as if the enemy were
expected any moment. We rode on to <i>la ville
basse</i>, the other and more modern Carcassonne,
a little checkerboard of a city with streets
running at right angles and so different from
the usual intricate streets of mediæval origin.
Securing rooms at the Grand Hôtel St. Bernard,
we hastened back, lest in the meantime an
apparition so mirage-like should have disappeared.
The first view of this silent, fortified
city makes one believe that the imagination
has played tricks. There is something fairy-like
and unreal in the vision. It seems impossible
that so majestic a spectacle could have
survived the ages in a form so perfect and
complete.</p>

<p>Carcassonne had always been one of our
travel dreams. From somewhere back in
high-school days came the memory of a French poem about an old soldier,
a veteran of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a><br /></span> Napoleonic wars, who longed to see <i>la cité</i>.
One day he started on his pilgrimage, but he
was sick and feeble. His weakness increased,
and death overtook him while the journey
was still unfinished. He never saw Carcassonne.
Since that time we had wondered
what kind of place it was that had made such
an impression upon the French writers, and
induced the French government to make of
it a <i>monument historique</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Copyright by Underwood &amp; Underwood</p>
<p class="center"><i>The castle and double line of fortifications at Carcassonne</i> <i>Page 103</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>At that moment, as we climbed the hill,
the past seemed more real than the present.
We looked for armored knights upon the wall,
and listened for the rattle of weapons, the sharp
challenge of the sentry. Crossing the drawbridge
over the deep moat, we were conducted
by the <i>gardien</i> along the walls and through
the fighting-towers, great masses of masonry
that had known so often the horrors of attack
and siege. In this double belt of fortifications
there were sentinel stations and secret tunnels
by which the city was provisioned in time of
war. Here, was a wall that the Romans
had built; there, a tower constructed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Visigoths; and all so well preserved, as if there
were no such thing as the touch of time or
the flight of centuries. Other places, like
Avignon, show the military architecture of the
Middle Ages, but it is the work of a single
epoch. The defenses of Carcassonne show
all the systems of military architecture from
Roman times to the fourteenth century. Nowhere
in the world can be found such a perfect
picture of the military defenses of the eleventh,
twelfth, and thirteenth centuries. The walls
and the huge round towers tell their own thrilling
tales of Roman occupation, of Visigothic
triumph, and of conquering Saracen. Then
we could understand why the old French
soldier longed to see Carcassonne, and why
tourists from all over the world include the
city in their itinerary of places that must
be visited.</p>

<p>From our lofty observation point on the
ramparts there was visible a great range of
country, the slender windings of the river
Aude, the foothills of the Pyrenees, and the
vague summits of the Cévennes. We followed
a silent grass-grown street to the church of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a><br /></span>St. Nazaire. It was beautiful to see the windows
of rare Gothic glass in the full glow of the
setting sun. Such burning reds, such brilliant
blues and purples! "<i>C'est magnifique comme
c'est beau.</i>" A French family was standing
near us. Before leaving the church, we looked
back. They were still under the spell of that
glory of color.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Copyright by Underwood &amp; Underwood</p>
<p class="center"><i>The walled city of Carcassonne</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>There may have been an elevator in the
Grand Hôtel St. Bernard, but we were not
successful in locating it. In a general way,
this modest hostelry was of the same type
which one finds in most of the small French
cities like Valence and Avignon. We were of
course greatly interested in gathering and
comparing impressions of provincial hotel life.
This was particularly interesting in a country
like France, where the provinces with their
rural and small-town life represent to such a
marked degree the nation as a whole. It
is always an instructive experience to discover
how other countries live, and to compare their
standard of living with our own. The hotel
life of any country, if we keep away from
fashionable tourist centers, usually gives an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
illuminating insight into the customs of that
people. We had often noticed that the French
are indifferent to matters relating to domestic
architecture. So long as the kitchen performs
its functions well, so long as the quality of
the cuisine is above criticism, it does not matter
if the rooms are small and gloomy or if the
architect forgets to put a bathroom in the
house. The Frenchman likes to dine well. The
café ministers to his social life. But with
these important questions settled to his satisfaction,
he is not inclined to be too exacting
about his domestic environment.</p>

<p>If we keep in mind these general observations,
it will be easier for us to understand the defects
and advantages of the French provincial hotel.
Most of the hotels where we passed the night
would not begin to compare, in many ways,
with the hotels to be found in American towns
of the same size. We noticed a characteristic
lack of progressiveness in so many respects.
It was exceptional to find running hot and
cold water. The corridors were narrow and
gloomy, the electric light poor for reading.
If there was an elevator, it usually failed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
work. Bathing facilities were on the same
primitive scale. The attractions of the writing
room were conspicuous for their absence.
In France it is usually the writing room
that suffers most; either it is a gloomy, stuffy
chamber, more fitted to be a closet than a
place for correspondence, or else located with
no idea of privacy, and in full view of everyone
coming in and going out. There were
no cheerful lounging or smoking rooms. Had
it been winter, the heating facilities would
probably have left much to be desired, and we
might often have repeated our experience
at the Hôtel Touvard in Romans. It was
January, and very cold. Arriving early in
the afternoon, we found that our rooms had
absorbed a large part of the frigidity of out-of-doors.
Complaints were fruitless. We were
informed that it was not the custom of the
hotel management to heat the rooms before
seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>In our selection of hotels we followed the
advice contained in the excellent <i>Michelin
Guide</i>, which has a convenient way of placing
two little gables opposite the names of hotels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
above the average. While they were not
pretentious, the quality of service was surprisingly
good. We could always get hot
water when we wanted it. The <i>maître de
l'hôtel</i> was always on the alert to render our
stay as comfortable as possible, and to give
us any information to facilitate sight-seeing.
Most of the hotels had electric lights, such as
they were; the bedrooms were clean and comfortable,
the cuisine faultless. If it be true
that one pays as high as two francs for a bath,
that is because bathing among the French is
more of the nature of a ceremony than a habit.
As for the small and neglected writing room, we
must remember that in France the café usurps
that function of the American hotel. This is
a national custom. How the Frenchman lives
in his café! Here he comes before lunch for
his <i>aperitif</i>, to discuss business or politics, to
write letters, to read the newspapers and play
games, to enjoy his <i>tasse de café</i> after lunch,
and in summer to while away the drowsy hours
of the early afternoon while listening to open-air
music.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to meet in Carcassonne two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
American students from Joliet, Illinois, who
were making a long European tour on "Indian"
motor cycles. One of them had received not
less than six punctures the preceding day and
was awaiting in Carcassonne the arrival of
another tire. He was beginning to be a little
doubtful about the perfect joys of motor cycling
on the French roads. Neither of them spoke
French, but their resourceful American gestures
had up to that point extricated them from
situations both humorous and annoying.</p>

CARCASSONNE TO TARBES</h2>


<p>Our ride toward Toulouse led us steadily
into southwestern France and nearer the
Pyrenees. From time to time the landscape,
with its fields of fodder corn, was peculiarly
American. The illusion never lasted long; a
château appeared on a distant hill, or a sixteenth-century
church by the roadside, and
we were once more in Europe, with its ancient
architecture and historical association, with its
infinite change of scenery and life.</p>

<p>Our trip never grew monotonous. There
was always the element of the unexpected.
For instance, in the village of Villefranche we
rode into the midst of a local <i>fête</i>. Banners
overhung the road; flags were flying from the
windows; ruddy-cheeked girls in gay peasant
dress were practicing in the dusty street a
rustic two-step or <i>farandole</i> in preparation for
the harvest dance.</p>

<p>While entering Toulouse we narrowly escaped
disaster. It was not late, but our depleted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
funds made it necessary to reach a bank before
closing time. Suddenly a bicycle rider shot out
from a cross street. There was a "whish" as
we grazed his rear wheel. The infinitesimal
fraction of an inch means a good deal sometimes.</p>

<p>We were too late; the banks were closed.
The next day was a business holiday, and the
following day was Sunday. Our letter-of-credit
would not help us before Monday. But as
luck would have it, we were able to discover and
fall back upon a few good American express
checks. Our hotel, the Tiviolier, gave us a
poor rate of exchange, but almost any exchange
would have looked good at that poverty-stricken
moment.</p>

<p>Toulouse, the flourishing and lively capital of
Languedoc, is a city of brick still awaiting its
Augustus to make of it a city of marble. The
old museum must have been a splendid monastery.
We dined in three different restaurants,
and fared sumptuously in them all. The <i>cassoulet</i>
of Toulouse was so good that we tried to
order it in other towns. The experiences of the
day very fittingly included a trolley ride along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the banks of the famous Canal du Midi, and a
visit to the remarkable church of St. Sernin,
considered the finest Romanesque monument
in France.</p>

<p>It would have been difficult not to make an
early start the next morning, the air was so
keenly exhilarating. The usually turbid Garonne
revealed limpid depths and blue skies as
we crossed the bridge. The road dipped into a
valley and then, ascending, spread before us
imposing mountain ranges. The Pyrenees were
in sight; every mile brought them nearer. The
name was magical. It suggested landscapes
colorful and lovely, strange types of peasant
dress, songs that had been sung the same way
for centuries, exquisite villages that had never
been awakened by the locomotive's whistle.
Range retreated behind range into mysterious
cloud realms. The road was like a <i>boulevard
Parisien</i> under the black bars of shadow cast by
the poplar trees.</p>

<p>At St. Gaudens, where we stopped before the
Hôtel Ferrière for lunch, an American party
was just arriving from the opposite direction.
There were three middle-aged ladies and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a><br /></span>French chauffeur who did not appear to understand
much English. The question of what
they should order for lunch was evidently not
settled. One of them wished to order <i>potage
St. Germain</i>. Another thought it would be
better to have something else for a change,
since they had partaken of <i>potage St. Germain</i>
the preceding day. The remaining member of
the party was sure it would be nicer if they
saved time by all ordering the same thing, but
did not suggest what that should be. The
chauffeur, who looked hungry and cross, merely
contributed a long-suffering silence to the
conversation.</p>

<p>Leaving our car in the garage and our sympathy
with the unfortunate chauffeur, we went
in to give appreciative attention to a well-served
ménu. So long as we remained in France we
never failed to order sardines. There is a certain
quality and delicacy about the flavor of the
French sardine which one misses outside of that
country. Coffee was served outside, under the
trees in front of the hotel, where we could
watch the life of the road. St. Gaudens is on
the main highway passing through the Pyrenees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
to Cannes and Nice on the Riviera. It is also
the central market for the fine cattle of the
Pyrenees, and for their sale and distribution to
other parts of France and the outside world.
We could see them swaying lazily along the
road, big, powerful creatures with wide horns
and glossy skin.</p>

<p>Descending from St. Gaudens into the plain,
we shot along the highway to Montréjeau,
where there was a steep ascent through this
bizarre little town, very Italian looking with its
arcaded streets, red roofs, and brightly painted
shutters. Then the moors of a high plateau
swept by us until we darted downward and
curved for several miles through a beautiful
wooded valley.</p>

<p>One of the front tires was evidently in trouble.
It was our first puncture in more than
thirteen hundred miles of motoring, not a
bad record when one considers the frequency
of such accidents on European roads,
where the hobnails of peasants lie in ambush at
every turn. We halted by the side of the road,
to put on a fresh tire, refusing many offers of
assistance from passing cars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>An unusual reception awaited us near Tournay.
The whole barnyard family had taken
the road for their private promenade. There
were a couple of mules, some goats, half a
dozen geese, and a large white bull. He was a
savage looking brute as he stood facing us and
angrily pawing the ground. It did not add to
our composure when a gaunt collie, awakened
by the noise, came snarling up to the car. At
this eventful moment, the engine stopped running.
No one of us was in a hurry to alight
and "crank up." The barnyard clamor would
have rivaled the well-known symphony of the
Edison Phonograph Company of New York
and Paris. At last a peasant appeared. He
whistled to the dog and succeeded in driving the
bull to one side, so that we could edge by to
less dangerous scenes.</p>

<p>The standard of living in these mountain communities
is not high. We saw one farmhouse
where the goats moved in and out as if very
much at home and on the same social footing as
their peasant owners. A mile farther on, we
were spectators at a dance which the peasants
were giving along the roadside. There was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
orchestra of two violins and a cornet, enthroned
upon a wooden platform brightly decorated
with flags and flowers. A dozen couples were
dancing up and down the road. Wooden shoes
were all the style. This unique ballroom floor
impressed us as being rather dusty. Steepsided
valleys yawned in quick succession.
There were views of the snowy Pyrenees. On
the side of a mountain we caught a moment's
glimpse of Tarbes in the plain.</p>

<p>The Grand Hôtel Moderne was a happy surprise.
The elevator actually worked, and the
running hot and cold water was a boon delightful
to find after these dusty mountain roads.
Tarbes is chiefly interesting for its great
horse-breeding industry. Barère, the regicide,
described by Macaulay as coming "nearer than
any person mentioned in history or fiction,
whether man or devil, to the idea of consummate
and universal depravity," was born here
in 1755. Tourist traffic has found Tarbes to be
a convenient stopping place on the through
route from Biarritz on the Atlantic to the winter
resorts of the Mediterranean shores, and also a
natural center for excursions to the Pyrenees.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a><br /></span>We remained in Tarbes an extra day to make
the trip to Lourdes, the tragic Mecca for increasing
thousands of Catholic pilgrims.</p>

<p>A short half-hour's ride and then Lourdes,
without doubt one of the most dismal and
melancholy places in the world. We are certain
that nothing would ever draw us there
again. For many, the trip is a pilgrimage of
faith; others go from curiosity; but for so
many suffering thousands the miraculous spring
at Lourdes is the goal of anxious hopes. They
gather from all parts of France, from England,
Scotland, and Ireland, and even from distant
parts of Europe. Last year there were over six
hundred thousand visitors. Around us, on
that afternoon, we saw the sick and the dying.
Some were hobbling along on crutches, others
walking helplessly with sightless eyes. Many
were being carried on stretchers, and there
were sights that we would rather not mention.
It seemed as if all the diseases to which mortal
humanity is heir were represented in that
pathetic throng. The following newspaper account
describes the pilgrimage which left Paris
in August, 1913:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"The great Austerlitz Railway station in
Paris presented a strange and terrible scene&mdash;and
above all, a distressingly pitiful one&mdash;yesterday
afternoon, when the annual pilgrimage
to Lourdes set forth on the long journey to the
little Pyrenean village. During last night
thirty-three special long trains converged on
Lourdes from every quarter of France. Every
train ran slowly because of the many sick people
on board. And this morning all the trains will
reach their destination and will discharge their
pilgrims at the station near the shrine.</p>

<p>"From two to four o'clock, the greater part
of the Austerlitz station was given up entirely
to the pilgrims. The railway servants withdrew,
and their places were taken by hundreds
of saintly faced Little Sisters of the Assumption,
and brave men of all ages and all ranks in life,
all wearing the broad armlet that denoted their
self-sacrificing service to the sick and helpless.
One by one, on stretchers, in bath chairs, over a
thousand suffering people, men and women of
all ages, youths and little children, entered the
great hall of the station.</p>

<p>"Each, as he or she is brought in, is laid upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
a bench transformed into an ambulance, to
await the departure of the train. A silence that
is almost oppressive falls upon the usually noisy
station; people speak in whispers, and move
with silent feet.</p>

<p>"Then the train&mdash;the long white train for
the <i>grands malades</i>&mdash;moves softly in to the platform,
and each poor human parcel is gently
convoyed to its allotted place. Eventually, the
long task is over, and then came the last moving
ceremony. The Cardinal Archbishop of
Paris passed slowly down the train and blessed
the sick within it. A moment after, without a
whistle or a sound, the long white train moved
out.</p>

<p>"Eight other equally long trains followed, the
last bearing at the rear the Red Cross flag."</p>

<p>We watched the procession forming to move
toward the sacred miraculous spring, such a sad
procession,&mdash;the halt, the maimed, and the
blind, who had come, many of them, thousands
of miles to bathe in the icy waters and be
healed. Attendants passed us, carrying a sick
man on a stretcher; the eyes were closed, the
features white and fixed. We saw a mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
clasping a sick child; she also joined the slow,
pitiful procession. Where will you find such
a picture of human suffering! It was all
like the incurable ward of a vast open-air
hospital.</p>

<p>The fame of Lourdes dates back to 1858, when
a little village girl, fourteen years old, named
Bernadette Soubirons, said that she had seen
and talked with the Virgin. This happened
several times. Each time the Virgin is said
to have commanded the child to tell others,
and to have a church built above the spring,
since its waters were to have miraculous powers
of healing. Crowds went with her to the
grotto, but she was the only one who saw anything.
The Bishop of Tarbes believed in her
visions. The fact that the child was "diseased,
asthmatic, and underfed," and also that "she
was not particularly intelligent," did not make
any difference. Pope Pius X issued a Bull of
endorsement. A basilica was built above the
grotto, and from that time the thousands
kept coming in increasing numbers every year.</p>

<p>We noticed that not all of the visitors to
Lourdes had come on a pilgrimage of faith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Everywhere one sees signs with large letters
warning against pickpockets. The evidence of
business enterprise was also unmistakable.
There were large hotels; one long street was
devoted to bazaars for selling pious mementos;
the windows of many shops contained tin cans
of all sizes for sale, these to be filled with
Lourdes water. The many advertisements of
Lourdes lozenges, made from Lourdes water, and
the women dressed in black, sitting at the
gates of the garden and selling wax candles,
all helped to give the place an atmosphere
of commercial enterprise.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
TARBES TO BIARRITZ</h2>


<p>From Tarbes the road climbed a high hill
above the city and then flung its marvelous
coils through the mountains to Pau, that
fashionable English resort where the Pyrenees
can be seen marshaling their peaks in such
grandeur. The country around Pau looked very
English. There were neat villages with high-pitched
roofs, spreading trees, and a feeling of
repose in the scenery very characteristic of the
large English estate. With almost fantastic
suddenness, the landscape changed. Peasant
houses showed traces of Spanish influence. We
saw no horses; plows and country carts were
drawn by bullocks. Such fine looking cattle of
the Pyrenees, hundreds of them! It seemed
at least every few minutes that a new drove
crowded in confusion down the road or across it,
and made it very difficult for us to get through.
There were many bulls. One hears so many
exciting tales about the savage bulls of the
Pyrenees that we were prepared for an attack
at almost any time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>If any one would like to make sure of having
an eventful experience, we suggest that he
motor through the Pyrenees in a red car. Other
motor cars kept the dust clouds flying. At one
railway crossing we counted ten automobiles
waiting for the bar to be lifted.</p>

<p>A score of hungry motorists were lunching in
the village inn of Orthez when we arrived. One
of them, a Frenchman, told us by all means to
see the curious fortified bridge that crosses the
Gave in this village. "<i>C'est très curieux. C'est
quelque chose à voir!</i>" The ruin, with the high
stone tower in the middle of the bridge, is a
thrilling relic of the religious wars. One can
see the tower window through which the unfortunate
priests and friars were forced by the
Protestants to leap into the rapid stream.
Those who breasted the strong current were
killed as they climbed out on the banks.</p>

<p>Bayonne was calling us. Our speedometer
registered the kilometers so quickly that there
were fully two hours of daylight to spare when
we crossed the long bridge over the Adour in
search of the Grand Hôtel. One street led us
astray, and then another, until we were in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
suburbs before discovering our mistake. It
was a fortunate mistake, for we were here
favored with a view of the fortifications of
Bayonne and the ivy-covered ruin of Marrac,
the château where Napoleon met the Spanish
king Ferdinand and compelled him to renounce
the throne in favor of his brother Joseph. It is
one of the strange turnings of history that the
same city where Joseph was proclaimed King of
Spain should have witnessed, six years later, the
downfall of his hopes.</p>

<p>Our return search was more successful. We
found the Grand Hôtel, and then were half
sorry that we had found it. The hotel was
crowded, the only <i>chambre</i> placed at our
disposal not large enough for two people. An
extra cot had been put in to meet the emergency.
The room was gloomy, and opened on
a stuffy little court. Many repairs were under
way, so that the appearance of the hotel was
far from being at its best. Had it not been
raining heavily we would have gone on to
Biarritz; but the torrents were descending.
For one night we submitted to the inevitable
and to the inconvenience of our cramped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
quarters. On descending, we noticed other
tourists still arriving. Possibly these new
victims were stowed away in the elevator or
in the garage.</p>

<p>Our stay in Bayonne was, under the circumstances,
not long, but long enough for us to
become acquainted with the <i>jambon delicieux</i>
and the <i>bonbons</i> for which the city is so well
known. After paying our <i>compte</i>, including a
garage charge of two francs,&mdash;the first which
we had paid since leaving Chambéry,&mdash;we
covered the few remaining kilometers to Biarritz,
stopping <i>en route</i> to pick up ten liters of
gasoline in order to avoid the more extravagant
prices of that playground for Europe's royalty
and aristocracy. The choicest feature of our
rooms at the Hôtel Victoria was the splendid
outlook upon the Atlantic and its ever-changing
panorama of sky and sea. The Spanish season
was in full swing. There is always a season in
the golden curve of Biarritz's sunny sands.
The Spanish invasion during the hot summer
months is followed by that of the French, when
Parisian beauties promenade in all the voluptuous
array of costly toilettes. For a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
months, Paris ceases to be the proud capital of
French animation and gayety. During the
winter, the place takes on the appearance of an
English colony; and the Russian royal family
has made spring a fashionable time for the
invasion from that country.</p>

<p>The charm of Biarritz is irresistible. It is
easy to see why Napoleon III made it the seat
of his summer court and built the Villa Eugénie,
which has since become the Hôtel du Palais. If
one searched the whole coast line of Europe, it
would be hard to find a spot so rich in natural
beauty. The sea has such wide horizons; no
matter how calm the weather, the snowy surges
are always rolling on the Grande Plage. Other
smaller beaches alternate with rugged, rocky
promontories. The coast line is very irregular,
full of arcades, caverns, and grottoes. At sunset,
when the wind falls and the air is clear, the
coast of Spain appears, the mountains respond
to the western glow, and the low cadence of the
waves makes the scene too wonderful for words.</p>

<p>We always looked forward to the morning
plunge into the cool breakers. Eleven o'clock
was the popular hour. Then the Plage was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a><br /></span>covered with brilliant tent umbrellas. There
were the shouts of the bathers as the green,
foaming combers swept over them. The beach
was a kaleidoscope of color and animation.
Dark-eyed <i>señoritas</i>, carrying brightly colored
parasols and robed in the latest and most
original French toilettes, walked along the shore.
The Spanish women are very fond of dress, and
especially of anything that comes from Paris.
Often the breeze would sweep aside their veils
of black silk, and show their powder-whitened
faces. French girls, daintily gowned and with
complexions just as "artistic," were busy with
delicate embroidery. There were Basque nursemaids
whose somber black-and-white checkerboard
costumes contrasted with the latest styles
from the gay metropolis. All types were there,
from the portly German who adjusted his
monocle before wading into the frothy brine, to
the contemplative Englishman who smoked his
pipe while watching the animated scenes around
him. Where will one find a more cosmopolitan
glimpse of fashionable Europe in the
enjoyment of a summer holiday! After the
plunge comes the drying off on the warm sands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
or the walk, barefooted and in bathrobe, along
the Plage; then lunch in the casino restaurant
above the sea, while an Italian orchestra
plays music that one likes to hear by the ocean.
For our <i>tasse de café</i> we would choose one of
the cafés along the crowded avenue Bellevue.
What a display of wealth and fine motor cars!</p>

<p>On one of these occasions we saw the young
King of Spain stop his Spanish car before one of
the stores. He was bareheaded, and was driving
his own car. One of his officers sat with
him. The king is a keen sportsman, and
motoring is one of his favorite diversions.
Under the reign of this popular and aggressive
young monarch there ought to be great progress
in the improvement of the Spanish roads and in
the opening of Spain's scenic wealth to the
tourist world. Toward the close of the afternoon
every one went to the beautiful casino
to enjoy the concert and <i>une tasse de thé</i>, and
then later in the evening to watch the brilliant
spectacle of dress and gayety.</p>

<p>The interesting places around Biarritz are
part of its attraction. If we had stayed there
for months, there could have been an excursion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
for each day. Placed beside the ocean, at the
foot of the Pyrenees, close to the Spanish
frontier and amid the fascinating Basque
country where the people have retained all their
primitive ways and quaint dress, Biarritz
makes an ideal center for one-day trips. The
excursion which we enjoyed most was to the
Spanish resort of San Sebastian, a modern seaside
town where the king and queen pass the
summer in their splendid Villa Miramar.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
A DAY IN SPAIN</h2>


<p>There is always a thrill about motoring
for the first time in a new country. We
had long looked forward to crossing the Spanish
frontier and visiting the summer capital of King
Alfonso XIII. It was a ride of about thirty
miles, far too short for one of the most interesting
sweeps of country to be found anywhere in
Europe.</p>

<p>There was plenty of variety. This Basque
country, forming a triangular corner of northern
Spain and reaching over into France, is full of it.
The people speak a dialect which is as much a
puzzle to Spanish as to French. Until less than
half a century ago, they had retained their independence.
Proud of their history, and claiming
to be the oldest race in Europe, they still cling
to their language and hold to their ancient
customs, their dances, songs, and pastoral
plays. In this region of valleys and mountains
we were always within sight or sound of the sea,
the road approaching a smooth, white beach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
washed with foam, or sinking into a quiet valley
drowsy with the faint monotone of the waves.</p>

<p>A few miles before reaching Spain is the old
seaside town of St. Jean-de-Luz, once the winter
headquarters of Wellington and now buried in
the shade of its venerable trees. The life in this
little village of only four thousand people was
not always so simple as it is now. Louis XIV
was a frequent visitor, with his courtiers. One
can see the château where the "Grand Monarque"
lodged at the time of his marriage to the
Infanta Marie Thérèse of Spain on June 9, 1660.
Another page from this gorgeous period is the
church of St. Jean Baptiste, where the ceremony
took place. Following the Basque custom, the
upper galleries are reserved for the men, while
the area below is reserved for the women.</p>

<p>On reaching the Franco-Spanish frontier
village of Béhobie a French officer appeared
and, after he had entered the necessary details
in his book, allowed us to cross the
bridge over the Bidassoa River into Spain.
This part of the town is called Béhobeia. It is
a unique arrangement, this administration of
what is practically one and the same town by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
two different countries. Yet the difference
between Béhobie and Béhobeia is as great as
the difference between France and Spain. The
houses across the river began to display the
most lively colors. It would have been hard to
say whether browns, pinks, blues, or greens predominated.
Some of the people wore blue
shoes. Red caps were the style for cab drivers.
Of course we looked around for some of our
"castles in Spain," but saw instead the Spanish
customhouse. An official came out, modestly
arrayed in more than Solomon's glory. He
wore red trousers, yellow hose, and blue shoes,
and looked as though in more prosperous days
he might have been a <i>matador</i>. We had forgotten
to bring along a fluent supply of Spanish.
The oversight caused us no inconvenience.
French is sufficient to carry one through any
matter of official red tape.</p>

<p>One hears many reports about the difficulty
of passing the Spanish customhouse, the severity
of the examination, of the long delays. At our
hotel in Biarritz they told us that the only safe
way would be to pay eight francs to a private
company on the French side of the frontier, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
that with the <i>passavant</i> so obtained, together
with our <i>triptyque</i>, we would not only secure
prompt service but also make this company
responsible for our safety while in Spain. So
much solicitude made us wonder just what percentage
of our eight francs would be received
by this hotel proprietor, so we decided to cross
the frontier without the much advised <i>passavant</i>.</p>

<p>These warnings proved to be exaggerated.
The delay was not greater than it would have
been in France or Germany. The <i>douaniers</i>
were, nevertheless, keenly alert to prevent the
smuggling of motor supplies for purposes of sale
in Spain. These articles are much more expensive
in Spain than elsewhere in Europe. The
number of our tires was noted, so that the
officials could make sure that we carried the
same number of tires out of the country.
Another arrangement, new to us, was the
method of ascertaining how much the gasoline
duty would be. The amount of gasoline in the
tank was calculated by depth only and not by
capacity.</p>

<p>A hundred fascinating scenes of Spanish
country life attracted our attention. Peasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
women, evidently returning from market, bestraddled
patient little donkeys, or walked,
balancing on their heads burdens of various
kinds. One of them carried a baby under one
arm, a pail filled with wine bottles under the
other, and all the time preserved with her head
the equilibrium of a basket piled several stories
high with household articles. We would not
have been greatly surprised to see another baby
tucked away somewhere in the top story.
These peasant types looked bent and worn,
their wrinkled faces old from drudging toil in the
fields; they fitted in perfectly with the dilapidated
farmhouses. The country was fertile,
with vineyards and cornfields, but a prosperity
in such contrast with the wretched homes of the
people. Little donkeys strained in front of
heavily loaded wagons that would have taxed
the strength of a large horse. The ox carts
were curious creations, the wheels being without
spokes, as though made from a single piece
of flat board. The small chimneys on the houses
resembled those which we had seen in Italy. We
did not see a single plow, not even a wooden
one; the peasants of the Basque country use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a><br /></span>instead the <i>laga</i>, or digging fork, an implement
shaped like the letter "h."</p>

<p>San Sebastian is a clean, fresh-looking city, a
place essentially, almost exaggeratedly, Spanish,
with all that gayety and vivid architecture
which one naturally expects to see in a place
patronized by the royal court. It was hopeless
to think of finding a place for our car in any
garage. They were all full. This was the day
of the bull fight. From different parts of Spain,
as well as from France, motorists had swarmed
in to see the <i>matadors</i> show their skill and
daring. In Spain the people divert themselves
at the bull fight very much as we would go to
see a baseball game. We saw motor cars
stationed in long files in the streets.</p>

<p>Leaving our car to stand in the rear of one of
these imposing lines, we strolled down a bright,
picturesque street to the Concha. Just as La
Grande Plage represents Biarritz, so the Concha
represents San Sebastian. "Concha" suggests
a bay shaped like a shell. The word exactly
describes the beautiful body of water around
which the city is built. Through the narrow
channel we could see the waves roll in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
contracted at first, then widening as they sweep
down the bay to break on the long, curving
stretch of yellow sand. From the Concha we
could see the white walls of the royal Villa
Miramar. The fortress La Mota guarded from
its high elevation the narrow entrance to the
harbor. We walked along the Paseo de la
Concha, in the dense shade of tamarisk trees
which nearly encircled the bay. Sitting in
chairs under the trees were Spanish girls, their
dark eyes glowing through their black lace
veils. The scene was full of color, completely
Spanish, the green of the tamarisks shining
between the golden sands and the white villas
which edged the water. We watched the
bathers, haughty dons from Madrid and
peasants from Aragon, for the moment on a
level in the joyous democracy of the surf.</p>

<p>After lunching at the Continental Hotel,
fronting on the Concha, we turned our steps in
the direction of the amphitheater, where the
bull fight was to take place. The tickets cost
twelve <i>pesetas</i> (about $2.40) apiece. It was not
with any anticipation of pleasure that we
decided to watch the Spaniards engage in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
national sport. The bull fight is a combination
of a scene from the Chicago stockyards and
from an ancient Roman arena. It is a succession
of shivers and thrills, from the first blast
of the trumpet announcing the entry of the
<i>toreadors</i> to the final <i>estocade</i>, when the last bull
falls dying upon the bloody sand. Few of the
<i>toreadors</i> die a natural death. Connected
with the large amphitheater is the operating
room, where the wounded fighters can receive
prompt treatment. We were told that it is
customary for them to receive the sacrament
before entering into the arena. Their coolness
and dexterity in sidestepping the mad rushes of
the bull are wonderful. But the moment comes
when the bull is unexpectedly quick, when the
foot slips just a little, or when the eye misjudges
the precious fraction of an inch which may
mean life or death. We noticed at regular
intervals, around the arena, wooden barriers,
placed just far enough from the main encircling
barrier to let the hard-pressed <i>toreador</i> slip in,
when there was no time to vault.</p>

<p>These exhibitions take place all over Spain,
and in San Sebastian at least once a week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
There is keen rivalry between Spanish cities
over the skill of their <i>toreadors</i>. Bull fighting
is not on the decline. The city of Cordova has
just started a school for the training of professional
bull fighters.</p>

<p>When we arrived the amphitheater was
crowded to the highest tier of seats. The vast
crowd, impatient, whistled and shouted. Attendants
passed among the spectators, selling
Spanish fans painted with bull-fight scenes.
The large orchestra was playing. Suddenly,
above the music and the noise of the crowds,
sounded the piercing blast of a trumpet. The
music ceased. The crowd became silent, then
cheered and clapped as doors swung open and
two horsemen dashed out and made the tour of
the arena. They were followed by a procession
of <i>toreadors</i>, <i>picadores</i>, and <i>banderilleros</i>, with
their attendants. The <i>picadores</i> were armed
with long pikes with which to enrage the bull.
They were mounted on wretched skeletons of
so-called horses, with one eye blindfolded. Six
bulls were to battle with their tormentors before
finally falling, pierced by the <i>toreador's</i> sword.
Three or four horses are usually killed by each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
bull. The <i>banderilleros</i> appear in the second
phase of the struggle, after the horses have been
killed. They are on foot. Their work is to
face the bull, infuriated by the pikes of the
<i>picadores</i>, and to plant in his neck several darts,
each over two feet long and decorated with
ribbons. The <i>toreador</i> comes on the scene the
last of all, when the bull, though tired, is still
dangerous. It would be a mistake to imagine
that the bulls are spiritless, or have been so
starved that they are weak, without strength,
energy, and courage. These animals that we
saw leap into the arena were all specially bred
Andalusian bulls, the very picture of strength
and wild ferocity.</p>

<p>We have no desire to describe in detail the
barbarous spectacle which followed. In front
of us sat an American couple. It was the lady's
first bull fight, and when the moment was critical,
the scene a gory confusion of bull, horses,
and <i>picadores</i>, she would scream and hide her
face behind her fan. In contrast, were the
Spanish girls seated around us. Their faces
were whitened more by powder than by emotion.
They would languidly move embroidered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
fans, or wave them with gentle enthusiasm
when the <i>banderillero</i> planted a daring dart or
the <i>toreador</i> thrust home the death stroke.</p>

<p>There was one moment in that exhibition,
however, when even their hardened indifference
to suffering was touched. One of the <i>banderilleros</i>
planted his dart in the neck of the bull,
but slipped while trying to get away from the
enraged beast. There was a cry of horror, a
groan of pity from the crowd as the great armed
head lifted its victim and hurled him thirty
feet through the air. The man struck heavily
on the sand, moved a little, and then lay
motionless. There was no shouting at that
moment. An agony of suspense pervaded the
amphitheater. But the bull was given no
opportunity to follow up his attack; a <i>toreador</i>
waved a red cape before his eyes; another dart
was planted in his neck. He turned savagely
to face and charge on his new assailants, who
nimbly avoided his rush. The wounded man
was carried from the arena. The enthusiasm
and cheers of the crowd were unbounded when
he revived and struggled with the attendants to
get back into the arena.</p>

<p>After all, human nature has changed but little
under these southern skies, so that what the
plebeian sought in the gladiatorial combats of
the amphitheater, the Spaniard or Frenchman
of to-day seeks and finds in the bloody scenes
of the <i>course de tauraux</i>.</p>

<p>We left early to get a start of the rush of
motor cars for the French frontier, but others
had done the same thing, so that by the time
the Spanish authorities had stamped our
<i>sortie definitive</i>, we found the international
bridge filled with cars, all impatiently waiting
to take their turn at the French <i>douane</i>. Then
amid a whirl of dust and a blowing of horns,
car after car leaped for the homeward flight.
Ahead of us and behind us, cars of every make,
motor horns of every variety. The dust fog was
continuous. Every one seemed racing to get
out of it. It was a likely place for an accident.
There was the wind-smothered shriek of a horn
as a French racer shot by to lead the exciting
procession. Farther ahead, the road turned
sharply, and we stopped to find thirty or
forty cars held up at a railway crossing. One
of them was the French racer; officers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
taking her number. It was growing dark, and
we lighted our lamps. Looking back from the
summit of a long hill, we could see the lights of
other cars swiftly ascending around the curves.
The wind was rising. Through the twilight
came the dull roaring of heavy surf. A revolving
beacon light, appearing and then disappearing,
announced that we were once more in
Biarritz.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
BIARRITZ TO MONT-DE-MARSAN</h2>


<p>Our three days in Biarritz had grown to
three short weeks before we were able to
break the spell of the alluring Grande Plage
and shape our course in a northeasterly direction,
along the foothills of the Pyrenees,
through the picturesque regions of Périgord
and Limousin to Tours and the châteaux
country. Bayonne, the fortress city, looked
peaceful enough with its tapering cathedral
spires rising above the great earthen ramparts,
now grass-grown and long disused to war. Not
far from Bayonne the road forked; we were in
doubt whether to continue straight on or to
turn to the left. A group of workingmen near
by ceased their toil as we drew near to ask for
information. The answer to our question was
very different from what we expected. One of
them approached the car, brandishing a scythe
in a manner more hostile than friendly, and
asked if we were Germans. This question concerning
our nationality came with all the force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of a threat. The restless scythe cut a nearer
airy swath. He had recognized the German
make of our car, and was convinced that we
belonged to the hated <i>nation allemande</i>. A
German motor car is not the safest kind of an
introduction to these French peasants, especially
when the <i>vin du pays</i> has circulated freely.
If appearances counted for anything, this particular
peasant was quite inclined to use his
scythe for more warlike purposes than those for
which it was originally intended. But his
companions, more peaceably disposed, seizing
him, drew him back from the car and gave us,
although reluctantly, the necessary information.</p>

<p>It was not our first experience of this kind.
In France there is a strong sentiment against
Germany. Our German car was often the
target for unfriendly observation. This fierce
ill feeling appears to be increasing. Never
since the war of 1870 has there been such a
period of military activity in the two countries.
Germany is raising her army to a total of nearly
nine hundred thousand men, at an initial cost
of two hundred and fifty million dollars, and
a subsequent annual cost of fifty million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
dollars. France has decided to meet these
warlike preparations by keeping under the
colors for another year the soldiers whose
term of service would have expired last fall.
This measure adds about two hundred thousand
soldiers to the fighting strength of the French
army. This increase of armament involves
necessarily the admission of the increase of
suspicion and antagonism.</p>

<p>At such a time of tension and suspense it
was for us a rare privilege to motor through
the French provinces, to stop in the small
towns and villages and to hear from the lips
of the people themselves an expression of their
attitude toward Germany. Rural France is
conservative; opinions and ideas form slowly,
yet there can be no doubt but that their
views represent the sentiment of the French
nation which is so largely agricultural. No
feature of our long tour through France was
more instructive than this opportunity to
study at first hand the influences at work to
widen the gulf between the two nations. We
conversed with soldiers, officers, peasants in
the fields, and casual French acquaintances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
whom we met in the cafés and hotels. Every
one admitted the gravity of the situation, and
said that nothing short of the actual shadow
of German invasion could have induced France
to submit to the tremendous sacrifices incident
to the large increase of the army.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm with which France has
consented to the enormous sacrifices entailed
by increasing the army on so large a scale
shows how widespread is the impression of
impending conflict. France realizes that there
is only one way to prevent war, and that is to
be so strong that Germany will hesitate to
take the fatal step. There have been past
menaces of invasion, and while it is true that
Germany has not made war for over forty years,
she has repeatedly threatened it. William I
and Moltke wanted to attack France in
1874 and again in 1875, before she had recovered
from the effects of 1870, to make it
impossible for her again to become a power
of the first rank. Russia and England supported
France; Germany drew back to wait
for another chance. Professor Lamprecht, the
great German historian, regrets that Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
did not hurl her armies against France at that
time. In the Delcassé crisis of 1905 France
was again threatened. We know now that
the Morocco negotiations between France and
Germany in 1911 kept Europe on the verge
of war for months.</p>

<p>This movement toward a more vigorous
expression of French national spirit, while
gathering strength for the last ten years,
actually dates from the sending of the gunboat
<i>Panther</i> to Agadir in 1911. This was
the igniting spark. It was in that moment
that the French nation found itself. The
generation that lived through and followed
the disastrous war of 1870 was saddened and
subdued. There was little of that spirit of
national self-confidence; politics played a larger
role than patriotism. But now a new generation
is to the front. Young France is coming
into power, and the result is a rebirth of self-confidence
and aggressiveness along patriotic
lines. It will no longer be possible for Germany
to be successful in a policy of intimidation
against France, as she was in the Congress
of Berlin in 1878. The new France is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
patriotic, too proud, too conscious of her own
strength, to concede to any unreasonable
demand for economic compensation that Germany
or Austria might make.</p>

<p>If there were no other reason for possibility
of war, the internal situation in Germany
itself would be enough to place France on her
guard. In spite of Germany's industrial progress,
the struggle of the masses for bread is
nowhere more bitter. The intense competition
in the markets of the world, the necessity
of paying interest on borrowed capital, the
fact of a vast and rapidly increasing population&mdash;all
this spells low wages in a country where
taxes are high and where the burdens of armament
are fast becoming unbearable. Such
conditions make for socialism. Already the
socialists form the most powerful party in the
Reichstag. The Kaiser wishes peace, but he
is, above all, a believer in monarchical institutions.
If socialism continues to spread
with its present rapidity, no one doubts that
he would stake Germany's supremacy in a
foreign war in order to unite the nation around
him and to divert the people from their struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
for a more democratic form of government.
A successful war with France would not only
mean rich provinces, a big war indemnity,
but it would also mean a new prestige for the
Hohenzollern government, sufficient to carry
it through the socialistic perils of another
generation.</p>

<p>In view of these facts, it is not surprising
that the French nation considers a conflict
inevitable, and especially when they see the
Kaiser appealing to his already overtaxed
and discontented people to make a supreme
sacrifice. With Germany the question is
one of economic existence. She can feed her
population for only a fraction of a year. More
and more she finds herself dependent upon
rival nations for foodstuffs and raw materials.
She has built up great steel and iron industries,
but the supply of ore in the province of Silesia
will be exhausted, at the present rate of consumption,
in about twenty-five years. Germany
will then be totally dependent upon
France, Spain, and Sweden for iron ore. But
France has an eighty per cent superiority over
Spain and Sweden in her supply of this material.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Her richest mines are situated in Basse-Lorraine,
hardly more than a cannon shot from
the German frontier. By the conquest of a
few miles in Lorraine, she would secure enough
iron ore to supply her iron and steel industries
for centuries. A suggestive commentary upon
Germany's aggressive plans may be noted in
the German atlas of Steiler. It writes the
names of different countries and their cities
in the spelling of each country. The French
cities and provinces are written in French,
with the exception of provinces of Basse-Lorraine,
Franche-Comté, and Bourgogne.
These are written in German.</p>

<p>Another force in Germany making for war
is the Pan-German League. This is the war
party of the armor-plate factories of the
officers of the army and navy, of a large part
of the German press, of the Crown Prince,
of many who have intimate relations with
the Kaiser. The spectacular demonstrations
of the Crown Prince in the Reichstag against
the too peaceful policy of the Chancellor at
the time of the Morocco negotiations, the sending
of the <i>Panther</i> to Agadir, the enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
increase of the army and navy in recent years,
the arbitrary suppression of French influence
in Alsace-Lorraine, have all been the fruits
of its efforts. There can be no question of
the tremendous power of this organization
which is so close to the heart of the Crown
Prince. If the Kaiser should die to-morrow,
France might well have reason to distrust
the warlike and impulsive young ruler who
would ascend the Hohenzollern throne. The
Crown Prince has recently written a book
called <i>Germany in Arms</i>. Its warlike fervor
shows how little he is in sympathy with the
emperor's loyalty to peace. What makes the
influence of the Crown Prince all the more
dangerous is the great discontent to-day in
Germany with the government's foreign policy
"of spending hundreds of millions upon a
fruitless and pacific imperialism."</p>

<p>Added to all these influences which are
straining the relations between France and
Germany, is the question of Alsace-Lorraine,
for more than two centuries a French province
and ceded to Germany after the Franco-Prussian
War as a part of the price of peace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
It is now a generation and more that Germany
has tried to assimilate the province, but with
so little success that to-day the people persist
more than ever in their sympathy with French
culture and their hostility toward Germany.
There has been immigration; probably two
fifths of the population are Germans, but the
two peoples do not mix. The silent struggle
between two civilizations goes on. The reason
for the failure of German government in Alsace-Lorraine
is due to its refusal to recognize this
dual civilization. Alsace is largely French
in sympathy; but instead of letting the people
cling to their local customs, Germany has
tried to make them think and speak German,
and adopt the German ways. Instead of
enjoying an equality with the other states in
the regulation of local affairs, the province
is treated as a vassal state, the governor being
responsible to the Kaiser. Naturally such a
system of government means the continual
clash of the two nationalities. The teaching
of French and French history has been almost
suppressed in the schools, and the younger
generation compelled to learn German. "But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
they are French at heart, and after leaving
school return again to the traditions of their
family. After forty years, no music stirs them
like the <i>Marseillaise</i>." It is said that the little
Alsatian schoolboys, when on a trip to the
frontier, decorate their hats and buttonholes
with the French colors. No one can be long in
Strassburg without realizing the futility of Germany's
campaign against French influence. It
is true that there is a certain veneer of German
civilization; the policemen wear the same uniform
as the Berlin police; German names appear
over the principal shops; but in the stores and
cafés one hears the middle-class Alsatians speaking
French; French clothes, French customs
prevail. In a word, the people, without French
support, have gradually become more French
in feeling and in culture than at the moment of
annexation. One effect of this struggle against
Germany's brutal and arbitrary policy has been
to start a strong undercurrent of sympathy in
France. In many of the French towns one sees
Alsace postcards in the store windows. The
picture on one card was a reproduction of a
French painting. A soldier appears on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
lookout in a forest. Not far away is a captive
bound to a tree. He is watching with expectant
joy the coming of the soldier. One can
easily guess that the captive is Alsace, the
soldier, France. We might also speak of the
petty annoyances practiced by the German
authorities in Alsace upon any one suspected of
French sympathy. Sporting clubs have been
dissolved. One reads of French sportsmen who
have been refused permission to rent "shootings."
The most recent measure of oppression
gives the governor of the province absolute
power to suppress all French newspapers, as
well as all societies supposed to favor French
culture.</p>

<p>This is only a part of the evidence at hand,
which gives the impartial observer reason to
believe that the friction of nationalities in
Alsace is the prelude to the larger and more terrible
struggle to-day is regarded in France as
inevitable. At the School of Political Science
in the sorbonne at Paris, where the superiority
of German methods used to be accepted without
question, it is said the professors can
now hardly mention them, for fear of hostile
demonstrations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>This question of Franco-German relations has
already overshadowed Europe. All attempts
to promote a more friendly understanding have
been fruitless. Even though the present tension
be only temporary, it is very doubtful if
there can be any approach to better relations
until Germany has solved the question of Alsace-Lorraine,
abandoning her policy of rough-shod
assimilation, recognizing the existence of a dual
civilization, granting autonomy of local affairs,
and welcoming the province, on an equal footing
with the other German states, to the brotherhood
of the empire. With this source of discord
removed, Alsace-Lorraine might become
a bond instead of a barrier between France
and Germany. Such a solution, however
remote, would be an important step toward
a more auspicious era of friendly feeling, of
good faith. Unfortunately, the Kaiser is opposed
to this conciliatory policy. The fact
that Alsace-Lorraine belongs to the empire
as a whole, and is therefore a bond of unity
between the German states, makes him unwilling
to disturb the present arrangement
and to recognize anything approaching a dual
government in Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>In the light of the above facts, our encounter
with the French peasant was of deep significance.
We could see behind it the forces&mdash;economic,
political, and sentimental&mdash;that are
at work to divide France and Germany.
Naturally, we were on the lookout for any
incident of this kind which would give us a
clearer view of the great question which is
placing such terrible burdens upon the two
countries.</p>

<p>We shall not easily forget our experience in
one French town. It was Sunday evening, and
the street was crowded with peasants and
artisans. One of us had stuck in his hat a
Swiss feather, such as is commonly worn in the
Tyrol of southern Germany. He purchased a
French newspaper, and after glancing through
it, dropped it in the gutter. This harmless act
very nearly involved us in serious trouble. A
burly Frenchman, noticing the feather and
taking him for a German, resented the apparently
contemptuous way in which the journal
had been thrown in the street. "<i>Vous avez
insulté la patrie</i>," he said in a loud voice. Like
a flash the rumor spread in the street that three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a><br /></span>Germans had insulted France, and a threatening
crowd surrounded us. A restaurant offering
the nearest refuge, we stepped inside to order
<i>une demi-tasse</i> and to wait until the excitement
had subsided. The <i>garcon</i> refused to
serve us. Outside, the crowd grew larger.
Then a policeman appeared. Upon learning
that we were Americans, he quickly appreciated
the humor of the situation, and explained the
misunderstanding to the crowd pressing around
the door. The excitement abated as quickly as
it arose, and we were allowed to continue our
walk without further interruption.</p>

<p class="center"><i>A familiar village scene in provincial France</i> <i>page 157</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Mont-de-Marsan has little to relieve the
monotony of its narrow village life. We
bumped over cobbled streets to the Hôtel
Richelieu, securing pleasant rooms which
opened on an attractive little court, enlivened
by a murmuring fountain. Dinner was hardly
over when the silence of the country began to
settle along the deserted streets. Such a
soporific environment was sleep-compelling.
An alarm clock was not necessary, for at early
dawn the street resounded with a medley of
noises, the varied repertoire of the barnyard,&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
hundred of them, in fact. Geese, chickens,
goats, and sheep were all tuning up for the
village fair. It is a mystery how we motored
through that maze of poultry and small wooden
stands heaped with fruits, poultry, game, even
dry goods&mdash;a kind of open-air department store.
The clerks were grizzled peasant women, some
of them eating their breakfast of grapes and
dry bread, others displaying tempting fruit to
entice us into a purchase.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
MONT-DE-MARSAN TO PÉRIGUEUX</h2>


<p>Motoring on to St. Justin, we plunged
into an immense forest broken only now
and then by small clearings and extending for
nearly sixty miles to the lumber town of Casteljaloux.
Woodland depths shut out the view.
Mile followed mile of dark pines and somber
perspective, an endless succession of dim forest
glades. The sappers were at their work, peeling
the bark from the long trunks and attaching
small earthenware cups to catch the resinous
gum. The road was so easy and smooth that
we did not find it difficult to take notes. From
the lumber yards of Casteljaloux was blown the
fragrant odor of fresh-sawn pine. Bright sunshine
flooded the wide-open country. The
freedom of the fields was around us again.
Here and there a maple showed the first gorgeous
colors of autumn.</p>

<p>In the enjoyment of these peaceful scenes we
ran unexpectedly through an encampment of
French soldiers. The army was getting ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
for the autumn maneuvers. Rifles were
stacked, and heavy accouterments deposited
on the grass. There were three or four large
Paris omnibuses transformed into kitchens,
motor-propelled and equal to a speed of twenty
miles an hour. Soldiers and officers watched us
curiously, almost suspiciously. Our notebooks
were hastily put aside. To be detected taking
notes from a German motor car in a French
encampment might have had unpleasant consequences,
or at least subjected us to serious
inconvenience. One of the officers took our
number; another "snapped" us with a camera,
but there was no attempt to interfere with our
progress.</p>

<p>The infantry wore long blue coats and red
trousers. One wonders why the French army,
otherwise so scientifically equipped, should have
such showy uniforms. If France went to war
to-morrow, her soldiers would be at a great disadvantage.
These uniforms would be a conspicuous
target at the farthest rifle range. All
other modern armies, like those of Germany,
England, or Italy, have adopted the "invisible"
field dress. But in France the colors have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
changed from the blue and red of Napoleon's
soldiers. A few years ago the War Minister
Berteaux tried to introduce a uniform of green
material. His efforts were without success;
the old color tradition was too strong. A
French officer commented as follows: "The
French army is one of the most routine-bound in
Europe. In some things, like flying, we have a
lead, because civilians have done all the preliminary
work, but in purely military matters,
like uniforms, officialdom delays reform at every
turn. It was not until 1883 that we gave up
wearing the gaiters and shoes of Napoleon's
time, and took to boots like other armies."
Even the officers whom we saw from our
motor car were dressed in scarlet and gold, red
breeches, and sky-blue tunics with gold braid.</p>

<p>A little farther on we passed several motor
cars filled with French officers; just behind
them came a dozen Berliet trucks of a heavy
military type, loaded with meat and ammunition.
These are the times of motor war. The
automobile has revolutionized the old method
of food supply. The long, slow train of transport
wagons, unwieldy and drawn by horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
has been replaced by swift motor trucks. The
French army is unsurpassed in mechanical
equipment. No effort has been spared to give
the army the full benefit of technical and
scientific improvements. This year, for the
first time, the Paris motor omnibuses are serving
as meat-delivery vans. With this innovation,
the army can have fresh meat every
morning, instead of the canned meats of other
years. The supply stations can be, in safety,
thirty miles from the front, and yet remain
in effective communication with the troops.
France is in grim earnest. The army is ready
and competent. The terrible lessons of the
Franco-Prussian war of 1870 have been learned.</p>

<p>A French officer with whom we conversed on
the subject of the French and German armies,
spoke of the superiority of the French artillery
over German guns in the recent Balkan war.
He said that the French were counting upon
their great advantage in this respect to offset
the German superiority in numbers. Commenting
on the wish of the Kaiser to visit Paris,
he was quite sure that the Kaiser would never
repeat the performance of his grandfather,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a><br /></span>Emperor William I, and arrive in Paris at the
head of the German army.</p>

<p>Our lunch in Marmande reminded us of a
banquet, but we were not yet French enough to
do full justice to three kinds of meat. France
is essentially a country of fields and gardens.
How we looked forward to every <i>déjeuner</i> and
every <i>dîner</i> so bountifully spread with the
famous products of her soil! The cuisine of
these small towns would not suffer in comparison
with the hotels of larger cities. One is
served more generously for half the price, and
the cooking is just as good.</p>

<p>A delightful succession of little foreign touches
brightened the ride from Marmande,&mdash;the
sluggish bullock carts, and vineyards interspersed
with tobacco fields, small churches with
bell cotes guarded by solemn, century-old cypress
trees; or perhaps it was an old Gothic
house or an ancient gateway with a piece of
mediæval wall still clinging to it. In one
village we saw bizarre stores, where the doorway
and window were one. This must be a
survival of Roman times, because we had seen
the same thing in Pompeii. We were quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
called back from antiquity, however, by the
cement telegraph poles which lined the road for
some miles. It was a surprise to see such evidence
of progress in a region where the years
leave so few traces of their march.</p>

<p>By this time the weather had become the
chief topic of conversation. A storm was
swiftly approaching. Tall cypress trees creaked
and swayed in the wind; the dark clouds,
nearly above us, shot out murky, ominous
streamers, like the tentacles of a gigantic
octopus; a few big drops fell; then the floodgates
burst. The drenching downpour was so
sudden that there was no time to put up the top
of the car. A tall tree offered refuge, but soon
each separate leaf had a tiny waterfall of its
own. Fortune did not entirely desert us, for a
small farmhouse, near by, promised a more
substantial shelter. It was just the kind of
peasant's home that we had often seen from the
roadside: an exterior of rustic quaintness,
built of stone and rough timbers, and artistically
framed in rustic vines and flowers. What
would the interior look like? We knocked. A
barefooted peasant woman opened the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
She was surprised to see three dripping apparitions,
apparently swept in by the rage of the
elements, but her invitation to enter could not
have been more cordial. The "<i>salon</i>" served
the purposes of kitchen, bedchamber, and dining
room. There was no trace of carpet or rug on
the cobble-stoned floor. The heap of straw in
the corner did not disclose whether it was for
dog or goat. On the wall hung a cheap
color-print of Napoleon. The hospitable "<i>Asseyez-vous</i>"
called our attention to a single
decrepit chair. There was not even a wooden
table. The rain, pattering down the chimney,
had almost extinguished the blaze in the small
open fireplace. Could anything have been
more barren or forlorn! Judging from the
appearance of our <i>hôtesse</i>, the bathtub either
did not exist or had long since ceased to figure
prominently in the domestic life of the household.
Two other peasant women of the same
neglected appearance entered without knocking.
One of them was barefooted; the other
would have been if she had not worn heavy
<i>sabots</i>. Both of them greeted us, but their
dialect was unintelligible. The sun coming out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
we said good-by with all the polite French
phrases at our command. The three peasant
women stood in the doorway and waved their
ragged aprons till we disappeared over the hill.</p>

<p>The bridge spanning the Dordogne into
cheerful Bergerac showed a town busy with
festal preparation for the coming of President
Poincaré. Pine branches were being wound
around telephone poles; festoons of green decorated
the houses; windows were bright with
flags; the streets overhung with arches bearing
inscriptions of welcome. We stopped at a tea
shop which was also a <i>boulangerie</i>.</p>

<p>It was interesting to discover, from the local
papers, that our route for the next two days was
to be part of the itinerary selected by President
Poincaré for his tour through the French
provinces.</p>

<p>This trip resulted from the president's desire
to know his people better, to become acquainted
with their local life, to visit their industries, and
especially to attract the attention of the motor
world to beautiful and interesting regions of
France which had too long been neglected,&mdash;these
slumberous small towns of the Dordogne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Limousin and Périgord, hidden from the broad
travel track, rich in local traditions and peculiarities,
wrapped in their old-world atmosphere,
surrounded by exquisite landscapes with
marvelous horizons. For these towns, the
president's coming was a big event. Some of
them recalled that since the days of Louis XI
no ruler of the state had visited their village.</p>

<p>We were to see Périgueux, with its precious
relics of Roman life and of the Middle Ages;
Limoges, noted for its beautiful enamels and
the center of the porcelain industry. It was
this part of France, so little visited even by the
French themselves, that President Poincaré
chose for his week of motoring. For him, as
well as for us, it was to be a delightful voyage
of discovery.</p>

<p>The twenty-nine miles to Périgueux proved
a memorable motor experience. Much of the
way was among steep, tree-covered slopes. No
one met us along the road.</p>

<p>It is surprising how far one can motor in
France without seeing any trace of human life;
areas of deserted country are so common;
abandoned farmhouses appear so frequently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
The reason lies not alone in the drift of population
to the larger towns and cities, but in the
fact that the French birth rate is failing to hold
its own. France, so rich in other respects, is
actually threatened by a decreasing population.
In 1911 the number of deaths exceeded the number
of births by 33,800. In the first third of the
last century, when the death rate was much
higher than now, there were six births to every
death; in 1871 the ratio had fallen to two births
to each death; in 1901 it was even. If we consider
the number of births per 10,000 inhabitants
during the decades of the last century,
we find the series to be an invariably decreasing
one&mdash;from 323 in 1800 to 222 in 1900. In 1870
Germany and France had each about 38,000,000.
Germany now has over 67,000,000, a gain of
27,000,000 over the present French population
of 39,340,000. France is thus placed at a great
disadvantage in the matter of national defense.
If we assume the German army to be only
750,000 soldiers, there would be one soldier to
every 89 inhabitants; France, to have the same
army, would be obliged to have one soldier to
every 52 or 53 inhabitants. The fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
French soldiers will now be compelled to serve
three years in the army, as compared with two
years in Germany, shows how France is now
paying the penalty for neglecting that vital
national problem of population.</p>

<p>Our ride to Périgueux gave vivid emphasis to
the above figures. There was little evidence of
peasant life. One had the impression of roaming
through a vast, uninhabited country.</p>

<p>From the top of a hill the town, and the valley
of the Isle, stretched beneath us a lovely view;
the windings of the river Isle, its bridges
mirrored in the crimson flood. Wooded hills
faded slowly into the blue depths of twilight.
The graceful Byzantine <i>campanile</i> and domes of
St. Front reminded us of the church of St.
Marks in Venice. Europe has few more romantic
corners. Descending the hill, we motored
over the river and into the town, under arches
of electric lights arranged in letters to spell
words of greeting to the president.</p>

<p>The Grand Hôtel du Commerce should have
been torn down years ago. It was a good
example of how poor a provincial hotel can be.
Even the recommendation of the Touring Club<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of France could not make us forget the musty
smells that filled rooms and corridors. We
opened wide all the windows. After a few
minutes, the fresh air revived us.</p>

<p>For a place that occupies so little space in the
pages of Baedeker, Périgueux is unique. Numerous
remains from the different epochs of
history may be found. The Roman period, the
Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and modern
times have all left their imprint. There is the
massive tower of Vesône, once part of a Gallo-Roman
temple. The Château Barrière has one
curious feature: a railroad runs through the
deep moat of feudal times. We shall need all
our superlatives to describe the Jardin des
Arènes. Where else will you find a public
garden laid out on the site of an ancient Roman
amphitheater, keeping the same size, the same
circular form, and even preserving some of the
original arches to admit the modern public? A
French journalist once wrote that "even without
its bright sunlight, even without imagination,
Périgueux remains one of the quaintest
towns in the world and one of those places
which the French people would visit in crowds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
if it were situated in another country." Viewed
from a distance, the cathedral of St. Front
makes a striking appearance; the five huge
domes might have been transplanted from St.
Sophia of Constantinople.</p>

PÉRIGUEUX TO TOURS</h2>


<p>From Périgueux we followed the Isle for
some distance before turning to wind over
the hills. It was a region of chestnut trees, the
<i>marronniers</i> for which the province is so celebrated.
For miles the trees formed a stately
hedge along both sides of the highway, and
groves of them were in the near distance, their
spreading branches reminding us of English
oaks.</p>

<p>The ascent continued to Thivièrs, a tiny
village of the Dordogne. One of the <i>vieux
citoyens</i> pointed out the Hôtel de France as the
best place to lunch. "<i>On mange très bien lábas</i>,"
he said. The lunch was a <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>.
We had never tasted such <i>poulet au casserole</i> or
such <i>cotelettes de mouton grillées</i>. The <i>lievre</i> had
a delicious <i>suc de viande</i> which went well with
the <i>pommes frités</i>. There was <i>vin à discrétion</i>,
and, besides, different kinds of <i>fromage</i> and the
French melons, golden and juicy and always the
best part of the repast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing is more delightfully characteristic of
these small towns like Thivièrs than the delicacies
peculiar to them. These little communities,
so different from each other in local
customs and mannerisms, are just as unique and
original in their cooking. It was always interesting,
when we had lunch or dinner in a new
place, to scan the ménu for some new dish that
we had never tasted. Whenever the <i>garcon</i> or
<i>maître de l'hôtel</i> pointed to an item on the ménu
and said, "<i>C'est une specialitè de la maison</i>,"
then we knew that something good was coming.
One never tires of these French delicacies.
Our regret at leaving them behind was usually
tempered by the consolation that something
equally new and delicious was awaiting us in the
next place <i>en route</i>. Each one of the following
names recalls experiences that we shall not soon
forget. These are simply samples. The list
would be too long if we named them all; the
<i>truites</i> of Chambéry; the mushroom patties of
Pierrelatte; the <i>jambon</i> of Bayonne; the <i>truffes</i>
of Périgueux; the <i>rillettes</i> and <i>vins</i> of Tours;
the <i>miel du Gatinais</i> of Orléans; the fried sole of
Chartres and Dieppe. In Normandy, sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
cider was often placed on the table instead of the
mild <i>vin du pays</i>. The cheese, <i>patisserie</i>, and
fruits were good everywhere.</p>

<p>Another item, which we cannot overlook,
never appeared on the ménu and yet always
flavored the whole repast. That was the geniality,
the provincial hospitality, which greeted us
in every little inn and hotel. The welcome was
just as hearty as the farewell. If there was some
one dish that we especially liked, the <i>patronne</i>
was never satisfied till she was sure that we had
been bountifully served. After so many experiences
like these, it is easy to understand why the
foreign motorist feels so much at home in France.</p>

<p>It was a splendid run to Limoges. The long
grades were scarcely noticeable, the easy curves
rarely making it necessary to check our speed.
Donkey carts were fashionable, and <i>sabots</i>, as
usual, in style. There was always a shining
river or green valley in sight. Haute-Vienne,
arrayed in flags and evergreens, awaited the
coming of the president. Here, as all along the
route, we saw the same joyful picture of festal
preparations. The bridge over the river Vienne
was like a green arbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the worthy citizens of these communities
were probably more familiar with town
affairs than the current events of the outer
world. We read in a local journal of a shopkeeper
who shouted a lusty "<i>Vive Faillières</i>,"
to greet the president's arrival. The mayor of
one village threw himself in front of the presidential
car, and threatened to commit suicide if
the president did not make a speech, as he had
done in a neighboring town. These petty
municipal jealousies gave us a picture of France
in miniature. What country is more torn by
faction! Internal dissension is the nation's
peril.</p>

<p>The river kept us company until Limoges was
in sight. The president had left the city only
a few hours before our arrival. Decorations
were still in their splendor. One <i>arc de triomphe</i>
bore the words "<i>Vive Poincaré</i>." Another
read, "<i>Nos fleurs et nos c&oelig;urs</i>." This popular
ovation seems remarkable when we consider the
strength of socialism in France, and the fact
that Limoges is a socialistic center. The mayor,
a socialist, refused to receive the president. The
City Council was not present at the festivities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
welcome. Municipal buildings like the Hôtel
de Ville were not decorated. All this was in
accordance with instructions received from the
leaders of the socialistic party. It was even
considered unsafe for the president to include
Limoges in his itinerary. But the people, the
wage earners, the various trade organizations,
acted for themselves. Their spontaneous, enthusiastic
greeting was all the more striking in
contrast with the cold indifference of the city
authorities. To be in an important French
city at just this time, on the very day when the
president was there, to see all the preparations
for his welcome, to hear the people talk about
him and praise him, made us feel that we had
been close indeed to one of the great personalities
of modern Europe. France has found
her leader, a man of vast energy who understands
his country's problems and is peculiarly
fitted to solve them. His motor tour through
the provinces was like a triumphal march.
Everywhere he preached that gospel of unity
which is the great need of the hour.</p>

<p>Thanks to a letter of introduction, we had
the interesting privilege of visiting a porcelain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a><br /></span>factory and of seeing the different processes
through which the product passes from the
shapeless lump of clay to the final touch of the
artist's brush. The city reflects the artistic
spirit of its inhabitants. One notices many
attractive garden plots and window gardens,
and the beauty of the flowers appears in their
art. These artists can reproduce them in
porcelain and enamel because first of all they
have painted them in their hearts.</p>

<p class="center"><i>A convenient way to carry bread</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>After Limoges, came Tours as the goal of the
day's run through the pastoral beauties of
Limousin to the châteaux of Touraine. The
air was crisp and clear. Two hours of easy
running through the bright September sunshine
brought us to the Palais Hôtel in Poitiers before
noon&mdash;Poitiers, the city of old Romanesque
churches and older traditions, where are living
so many of the <i>vieille noblesse</i> who would rather
eat dry bread than make their sons work. The
echoes of Parisian rush do not penetrate these
quiet streets. The people drink <i>tilleul</i> after
lunch instead of coffee. The effect is to make
them drowsy. In fact, we have seldom visited
a place with such an atmosphere of slumber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
After lunch the <i>patronne</i> offered to show us
some of the hotel rooms. Most of them were
connected with a private <i>salle de bain</i>. The
price was so reasonable that we at once placed
this hotel in a class by itself. As before stated,
bathrooms do not enter largely into the life of
the French home or hotel. Even in cities like
Tours, the public bathtub still makes its round
from house to house once a week, or once a
month as the case may be. An Englishman,
who so often places cleanliness above godliness,
is unable to understand this French indifference
to the blessings of hot and cold water. In Lyons,
the third largest city of France, there is a popular
saying that only millionaires have the <i>salle de
bain</i> in their homes. These facts will help to
explain why the Hôtel Palais, with its many
bathrooms, made such an impression on us.
We regret that our snapshot of this hotel did
not turn out well. We would have had it
enlarged and framed.</p>

<p>From Poitiers to Tours one is on the famous
Route Nationale No. 10, that remarkable
highway which Napoleon built across France
into Spain when his soldiers made the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
march only to meet defeat in the Peninsular
campaign. We had followed it from Bayonne
to Biarritz and on to San Sebastian. To see
this familiar sign again seemed like the greeting
of an old friend. It looks like an army road, the
trees are planted with such military precision.
One could almost feel the measured step to
martial music. This straight-away stretch for
so many miles through the country suggested
the great soldier himself. Like his strategy,
there was no unnecessary swerving. It was the
shortest practicable line to the enemy's battle
front. These magnificent <i>routes nationales</i> are
the best illustration of the order and system
that he gave to French life. We have often
thought too much emphasis has been laid on the
destructive side of Napoleon's career. He
shook Europe, but Europe needed to be shaken.
The divine-right-of-kings theory needed to be
shattered. France needed to be centralized.
If our motoring in that country had been limited
to Route Nationale No. 10, this would have
been enough to give us a new appreciation of
Napoleon as a constructive force.</p>

<p>The afternoon's ride flew all too quickly. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
was glorious, as evening approached, to watch
the harvest moon growing brighter and larger
on our right, while the sunset fires slowly
changed from burning colors to dusky gray.
Tours was in sight, Tours on the Loire, names
that we had always linked with the châteaux of
Touraine. A multitude of lights gleamed from
the plain below. Descending the hill, we
crossed the Loire to the Hôtel Metropole.</p>

<p>Tours was not what we had anticipated.
One reads about the kings of France who resided
here, from Louis IX to François I. Plundering
Visigoths, ravaging Normans, Catholics and
Huguenots, even the Germans in 1870, all in
their turn assailed the unfortunate city. We
looked for half-ruined palaces and vine-covered,
crumbling walls. The reality spread a different
picture. Aside from the streets and houses of
mediæval Tours, little remains of great historic
interest. This large, busy industrial center
produces so many articles that the list resembles
a section from the new Tariff Act.</p>

<p>We enjoyed varying our châteaux excursions
with rambles in the city. There are old gabled
houses in the Rue du Change, where the overhanging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a><br /></span>stories rest on brackets richly carved.
One loses all sense of direction in some of these
intricate streets. The cathedral compelled us
to linger longer than we had intended. The
ages have given such a warm, rich gray to the
stones that the usual atmosphere of frozen
grandeur was absent. Our interest in Gothic
glass and mediæval pillars was diverted by a
wedding that was going on in the cathedral.
One of the priests, who was assisting in the ceremonies,
left his duties to offer us his services as
guide; there is always a certain magnetic power
to the American tip. Of course we climbed the
Royal Staircase of the North Tower, even counting
the number of steps. The fact that our
numbers did not correspond is all that saves this
part of our story from resembling a quotation
from Baedeker. The panorama showed the city
spread out in a plain between the Loire and the
Cher. We grew to have an intimate feeling
for these old cathedral towers. When returning
along the Loire from our châteaux trips,
it was always a beautiful sight to see them in
the distance, clear-cut and luminous, or looking
like majestic shadows in the haze of
twilight.</p>

THE CHÂTEAUX OF TOURAINE</h2>


<p>Tours made a convenient headquarters
for our explorations in Touraine, where
along the banks of the Loire and the Indre
were enacted the most important events in
French history from Charles VII to Henry IV.
Every one would be interested in an historical
course having for subjects these Renaissance
homes of France's gallantry and beauty. One
lingers, and imagines the scenes of magnificent
revel, the court life of kings and queens when
the artistic and architectural glory of France
was at its zenith.</p>

<p>It was easy to plan our one-day trips so as
to include on the same circuit several of the
most famous châteaux. The first day we
motored to Azay-le-Rideau, Chinon, Rigny-Ussé,
and Langeais, in the order named. The
distances were short, perhaps one hundred
and twenty-five kilometers in all, so that we
could go leisurely and yet return to Tours
before dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>With this wonderful program before us, we
crossed the Loire, and traversing a wooded
country with areas of vineyards and gardens,
came to Azay-sur-Indre. There were not even
hints of a château, nothing but the aimless
cobbled streets of the typical French town.
We halted beside a long wall which holds back
the encroaching village and betrays no sign of
the surprise in store within. Any one about
to see his first château would do well to visit
Azay-le-Rideau, a veritable gem of Renaissance
style. This graceful pile of white architecture,
as seen to-day, belongs to the early part of the
sixteenth century. François I built it. That
patron of the <i>beaux arts</i> has placed our twentieth
century under lasting obligation. Every line is
artistic. There is the picture of airy lightness
in the turrets and carven chimneys that rise
from the high sloping roofs of blue slate. In
gratitude for the preservation of this perfect
work one forgets the ravages of the French
Revolution. Passing over a small bridge, we
followed the <i>gardien</i> through the sculptured
doorway and up the grand staircase so often
ascended by François and his Parisian favorites.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
We were permitted to see the ancient kitchen
and old kitchen utensils of wrought iron.
Paintings and Flemish tapestries adorned the
billiard room. The king's bedroom has a fine
specimen of rare mediæval flooring. The ballroom,
with its Gobelin tapestries, suggested
the artistic luxury of the age. From nearly
every window there were pleasing outlooks
on a green woodland and on the sunny branch
of the Indre, which surrounds the château on
three sides. It was all a picture of peace.
Azay-le-Rideau is a château of elegance, instead
of defense. One could imagine it built
by a king who had leisure to collect beautiful
works of art and whose throne was not seriously
threatened by invading armies.</p>

<p>Quite different from it is the château of
Chinon, an immense ruined fortress built on
a hill above the Vienne River. The walls
are as impregnable as rocky cliffs. Chinon
was the refuge of a king who had need of the
strongest towers. Charles VII, still uncrowned,
assembled here the States-General while the
English were besieging Orléans. It was a
time of despair. The French were divided,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
discouraged, helpless, their richest provinces
overrun by English armies. At this lowest ebb
of French history, a simple peasant girl came
to Chinon. Only a solitary gable and chimneypiece
remain of the Grande Salle du Trône where
Jeanne d'Arc told the king of her visions from
heaven and of mysterious voices commanding
her to save the nation. We entered the tower,
her rude quarters till she departed a few weeks
later to lead the French troops to the victory
of Orléans.</p>

<p>After lunch we motored through the gardens
of Touraine to the magnificent château of
Ussé. The elegant grounds and surrounding
woods formed an appropriate setting. Terraces
descended to the wall below, where our
view swept over a wide range of picturesque
country, watered by the Indre. Much to
our regret, we were not permitted to visit the
château, which is now occupied by a prominent
French family.</p>

<p>Langeais, a few miles away, gave us a more
hospitable welcome. It is a superb stronghold
upon the Loire, and has dark, frowning towers
and a heavy drawbridge which looks very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
mediæval. The widow of M. Siegfried, a
Parisian millionaire, lives here part of the year
with her daughter. M. Siegfried, who bought
the château, was interested in art as well as
in ships. He lavished his wealth to furnish
the different rooms with furniture and <i>objets
d'art</i> peculiar to the period. His will provides
that after the wife's death the château
is to belong to the Institute of France, and
that a sum equal to six thousand dollars is to
be devoted to its upkeep. Other tourists
had arrived. The <i>concierge</i> conducted our
party through the many different rooms,
lavishly furnished and decorated in the period
of Louis XI and Charles VIII. There were
wide, open fireplaces. We were interested in
the Grand Salon, where the marriage of
Charles VIII and Anne of Brittany was celebrated
in 1491.</p>

<p>The return to Tours led along the banks of
the Loire. Rain was falling, a cold drizzle
which the rising wind dashed in our faces.
The wide sweeps of the river grew indistinct.
There were few carts to check our homeward
spurt through the darkening landscape. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a><br /></span>were fortunate in having so comfortable a
hostelry for a goal. The dinner, equal to the
best French cuisine, proved a pleasant ending
to a memorable day.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Chateau of Loches behind its imposing entrance</i> <i>Page 187</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The next morning ushered in one of those
golden fall days that seemed made for "châteauing."
The swift kilometers soon carried
us to Loches, that impressive combination of
state prison, Château Royal, and grim fortress
overlooking the valley of the Indre. So many
horrible memories are linked with the prisons
of Loches that we almost hesitate to record
our impressions. We have seen the dungeon
cells of the Ducal Palace in Venice and the
equally gruesome chambers of the Castle of
Chillon, but the dungeons of Loches are the
most fear-inspiring that we have ever penetrated.
Perhaps a part of this impression was
due to the <i>concierge</i> who showed us the prisons
where famous captives were incarcerated and
tortured at the will of monarchs. There was
one dark cell with a deep hole, purposely
fashioned that the victims should stumble
headlong to their fate. Our guide gave us a
graphic description of this method of execution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
In that gloomy hole, his sudden climax of
"<i>Très horrible</i>," would have made any one
shiver. Some of these cells extend an interminable
distance underground. It is not the
most cheerful experience to descend deeper
and deeper into this subterranean darkness,
to see the daylight growing fainter, to hear the
trickle of water from the cold rocks, and then
to imagine the slow, frightful death of many a
political captive. Louis XI, not satisfied with
the capacity of the dungeon, built a great round
tower, the Tour Neuve, where he imprisoned
the rebellious barons whose lives could not be
taken.</p>

<p>Some one has written of this amiable king
that "his reign was a daily battle, carried on
in the manner of savages, by astuteness and
cruelty, without courtesy and without mercy."
In the cell occupied by Ludovico Sforza, the
Duke of Milan, may be seen the paintings,
sun dial, and inscriptions with which he tried
to ward off approaching madness. This prisoner
is said to have died from the joy of regaining
his liberty. Louis XI was resourceful in his
method of imprisonment. In a subterranean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
room of the Tour Neuve we were shown
where the Cardinal Balue was suspended in a
small cage. One reads that he "survived so
much longer than might have been expected
this extraordinary mixture of seclusion and
exposure." Almost as horrible was the window
cell in one of the torture chambers. The
prisoner was confined on a narrow stone ledge
between two rows of bars. There was barely
space to stand up or lie down. A handful of
straw served for a bed. On the one side, he was
exposed to the elements, and on the other,
he viewed the torments of fellow prisoners.</p>

<p>We turned with relief to less hideous scenes,
to the apartments of the Château Royal,
occupied by the irresolute Charles VII, the
terrible Louis XI, and their successors; to the
tower, from the top of which we had a commanding
view of the quaint, mediæval town
and the wandering Indre. Our guide did not
forget to show us the tomb of Agnes Sorel,
the beautiful mistress of Charles VII. Two
little angels kneel at her head, while her feet
rest on two couchant lambs, symbols of innocence.
The monument would have made an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
appropriate resting place for a martyred saint.</p>

<p>From Loches, we motored through a deep
forest to the château of Montrésor, well protected
on its rocky height by a double encircling
wall, flanked with towers. Once within these
formidable barriers, we were delighted with
the pleasant grounds and green arbors above
the valley of the Indrois. The building dates
from the commencement of the sixteenth century,
and was small enough to look more like
a home than a palace. The <i>concierge</i> spoke
of a distinguished Polish family who occupied
it part of the year. This was the first "home
château" we had seen. Everything looked
livable; there was warmth and coziness and
refinement in the different rooms. We felt
almost like intruders into this domestic atmosphere.
Some of the paintings were by great
artists. One was Fleury's "The Massacre of
the Poles at Warsaw," on April 8, 1861. There
were rare specimens of antique furniture, and,
most interesting of all, the "Treasury of the
Kings of Poland," consisting in part of the
large gold dish and silver soup tureen presented
to John Sobieski by the city of Vienna, and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a><br /></span>the silver-gilt services of Sobieski and of
Sigismond II, King of Poland. The château
has a rich collection of works of art and souvenirs
relating to the history of Poland.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Chateau of Chenonceaux</i> <i>Page 191</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The Hôtel de France nearby spread before
us a ménu so good that we confiscated the <i>carte
du jour</i> as a souvenir.</p>

<p>Eagerly we looked forward to Chenonceaux,
built on the Cher, most exquisite of the French
châteaux and for centuries the rendezvous of wit
and beauty. Motor cars lined the roadside by
the gates of the park. Some of the visitors had
driven in carriages from the nearest railway
stations. We sauntered down an avenue of
trees to a large garden, rather a formal piece of
landscape work. The drawbridge offered access
to the château. François I purchased it.
Later, Henry II, ascending the throne, gave
it to his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. The
French women of that day had a big share in the
shaping of history; the conversations of the
boudoir were often more influential than state
councils. Diane built a bridge which connected
the castle with the other side of the river.
Twelve years later, the death of Henry II gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
his widow, Catherine de' Medici, a chance to
relieve her embittered feelings. She forced
Diane to exchange Chenonceaux for another
château. Upon the bridge built by her rival,
Catherine erected a long gallery, surmounted by
a banqueting hall. This fairy-like structure is
so strangely placed, one is reminded of a fantastic
ship moored in the river. It is remarkable
for its celebrated Renaissance architecture and
for the absence of bloody traditions. "Blois
is stained with the blood of Guise; Amboise
was the scene of massacre; Loches stands
upon unnumbered dungeons; Chenonceaux
alone has no bloodstain on its stones and no
groan has ever risen from its vaults. Eight
generations of kings took their pleasure there,
and a long line of brilliant and beautiful women
makes its history like a rope of pearls." Even
the gloomy, plotting Catherine did nothing to
disturb the peaceful records and gorgeous <i>fêtes</i>
of Chenonceaux. In the "<i>chambre de Diane de
Poitiers</i>" we saw a painting representing Catherine.
Those cold, brooding eyes looked capable
of anything, from the murder of the Duc de
Guise to the massacre of St. Bartholomew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>Two other châteaux of our itinerary still remained,
Amboise and Blois, the latter perhaps
the most famous of them all. We decided to
visit these châteaux <i>en route</i> down the valley of
Loire to Orléans. The following morning we
bade farewell to Tours. The road swept us
along the left bank of the Loire, all aglitter in the
September sunshine. What a wonderful stream
it is, the longest river in France, with its basin
embracing one fourth of that country! There
is not a river in the world like it. One feels the
breath of romance, the spell of historical associations,
the beauty of its curves sweeping
through a smiling land. "Perhaps no stream,
in so short a portion of its course, has so much
history to tell."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Along its banks flourished
for three centuries the court of the Valois kings.
There are vineyards, the remains of mediæval
forests, little villages that have scarcely changed
in a hundred years, and splendid châteaux like
those of Blois, Chaumont, Chambord, and
Amboise, almost reflecting their towers in the
water and rich in the wonders of the French
Renaissance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the châteaux along the Loire, Amboise
enjoys the finest situation. From across the
river we could see this dark Gothic mass rising
from its cliff-like walls to dominate the town
and far-winding stream. The panorama from
the high terrace is one of the indescribable
views of France. The real treasure of Amboise
is the exquisite Chapelle de Saint Hubert, due
to Charles VIII. His artistic zeal was tragically
interrupted. We saw the low doorway where,
according to tradition, he struck his head and
killed himself while hastening to play tennis.
On the terrace is a bust of Leonardo da Vinci,
who died here in 1519. The name of Catherine
de' Medici is connected with a frightful scene
that occurred in the courtyard. A Huguenot
conspiracy to capture the youthful François II
was discovered. The fierce Catherine not only
witnessed the executions from a balcony, but
insisted upon the company of her horrified
daughter-in-law, Mary Stuart. Twelve hundred
Huguenots were butchered. One writer<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
makes the following grim comment: "It was
a long job, of course, to kill so many, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a><br /></span>company could hardly be expected to watch it
all, but the noble victims were reserved for
their special entertainment after dinner."
Catherine seems to have had a peculiar fondness
for these innocent and edifying spectacles. We
descended the spiral roadway of the colossal
tower up which Emperor Charles V rode on
horseback when he visited François I. This
inclined plane was so perfect and gradual that
our motor car could have climbed it with ease.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Chateau of Amboise on the Loire</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Recrossing the Loire, we rode on to Blois for
lunch at that famous hostelry, the Hôtel
d'Angleterre, close by the river's edge. To the
château of Blois belongs historical preëminence.
This great castle was the center of French history
in the sixteenth century. Elaborate and
imposing, Blois recalls the splendor of the age
as well as its crimes. Such fireplaces and such
ceilings! The colors are crimson and gold.
Amid this gloomy grandeur moved Catherine de'
Medici. The memory of her presence alone is
enough to make the air heavy with intrigue and
murder, with all the passions that inflamed the
religious wars. Joining the usual tourist crowd,
we visited her apartments, including the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
bedroom where she died in 1589, at the age of
seventy, the most infamous of French queens.
To us, the strangest fact in the life of this fierce,
blood-loving queen is that she was permitted to
die a natural death. In one of the chambers
were curious secret cupboards where she may
have concealed her jewels. The floor above
suggested a terribly realistic picture of the
assassination of the Duc de Guise, whose popularity
and influence had aroused the jealousy of
Catherine and Henry III. The <i>concierge</i> explained
all the tragic details. This was the
<i>salle du conseil</i>, where, on the morning of the
assassination, the duke was summoned by the
queen to a council; that, the <i>cabinet neuf</i>,
where the king remained while the fatal blows
were being struck. And there, in the king's
chamber, at the foot of the bed, the spot where
the body lay when the king exclaimed, "He
seems greater in death than in life."</p>

ORLÉANS TO DIEPPE</h2>


<p>Leaving the châteaux country, we proceeded
to Orléans in the lower part of the
Loire valley, spending the night at the Hôtel
Saint Aignan. The general appearance of the
city is prosperous and modern. The walls
which once surrounded it have been turned into
promenades. Everything in Orléans seems
connected with Jeanne d'Arc. There is a bronze
equestrian statue with bas-reliefs of the "Maid"
who, clad in white armor, led her soldiers from
victory to victory. We hope sometime to be
present at the brilliant "Fête de Jeanne d'Arc,"
which is held every year on May 8, in commemoration
of her raising the siege of Orléans
in 1429. Small shops display postal cards
representing scenes from her life. The Musée
is filled with interesting souvenirs. In the
cathedral, where the people worship her as a
saint, we saw on the walls votive tablets bearing
inscriptions of gratitude to her for recovery
from sickness. In the same street is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
"Maison de Jeanne d'Arc" where she was
received by the Duc d'Orléans during the eventful
siege. That morning was filled with an
interesting series of historical sidelights.</p>

<p>From the vineyards of Touraine to the wheat
fields of Normandy; the change was complete.
Like an endless white ribbon, the road stretched
straight through the vast plain of La Beauce,
the granary of France. What far reaches of
level fields! There were no telegraph poles, no
hedges, no fences. We seemed to be moving
through a strange solitude, empty of human
face or habitation. The distant farmhouses
and windmills were too much like specks on the
horizon to seem real. There is, after all, no
scenery to compare with the beauty of the lowlands,
where every mood of heaven, every
change of sky, is part of a wonderful picture.
The weather, which was threatening when we
left Orléans, now looked more and more like a
storm. No shelter was in sight, nothing but
the open country, the great dome of heaven,
and the road ever narrowing ahead of us until its
indistinct thread merged into a faint blur. Swift
clouds took on a greenish, copper-colored hue,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a><br /></span>which deepened into black as they swirled
toward us. Then the hailstones began to fall
with a stinging force that increased with every
movement. It was one of those furious hailstorms
of northern France which are as characteristic
of that region as the mistral is of the
Midi. There were no mitigating influences.
The wind was pitiless, untempered even by the
shelter of a tree or barn. By stopping the car
and crouching behind it, we secured a little
protection from the biting blasts. The sun
soon burst through the cloud barriers. We
continued toward Chartres, stopping for a
moment at a railway crossing to "kodak" a
passing freight train.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Copyright by Underwood &amp; Underwood</p>
<p class="center"><i>The wheat fields of Normandy</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The approach to Chartres was impressively
picturesque. The double spires of its vast
Gothic cathedral, growing more distinct, finally
towered above the moat and the Porte Guillaume,
the fourteenth-century gateway of the
city. Our hotel, the Grand Monarque, gazed
upon the turmoil of a village fair. The din
was deafening. A merry-go-round added the
blare of brazen music; several hand-organs were
in discordant evidence. We mingled with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
peasants around the small booths, and were
almost enticed by a <i>jolie paysanne</i> into buying
a pair of small <i>sabots</i>. Our ride in the small
motor car of the merry-go-round was the
dizziest burst of speed on our whole trip.</p>

<p>Little Chartres is overshadowed by its mighty
cathedral. All interest concentrates there.
Many consider it the finest in France. Every
one would agree that the interior is incomparable.
Nowhere can we find a more sublime
expression of Gothic art. Those who fashioned
this "sacred rock-work set to music" belong
to the great unknown; their names are buried
somewhere back in the early part of the thirteenth
century when the cathedral was built.
At least, they have given us a picture of their
times; such structures could not be erected
now. Our age is attuned to a different key;
there are too many distracting influences.
Then, there were no popular theaters, and few
books or forms of amusement. The church was
the natural center of thought and life. Only
the religious inspiration of a people naturally
artistic could have created the immortal works
which the cathedral builders have bequeathed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>For a few miles outside of Chartres we were
again on Route Nationale No. 10. The
blue-and-white advertisements of various productions
appeared close to the road signs.
This is a common practice of the French
advertisers, who wish to catch the eye of
the <i>voyageur</i>. We had no idea there were so
many different makes of <i>pneus</i> and <i>chocolats</i>.
In the roadside hamlets the French advertiser
makes use of the sides of barns and the
corners of houses, but there is very little
landscape advertising. Being Americans, we
were impressed by this absence of disfiguring
advertisements along the countryside in Normandy
and other parts of France. The "Bull
Durham" herd, so often found in American
meadows, would not thrive in French pastures.
It would be taxed out of existence.</p>

<p>Hardly had we sat down to lunch in the
Hôtel du Grand Cerf of Nonancourt when
there was a great shouting and beating of
drums outside. A group of conscripts marched
noisily by. They wore red, white, and blue
cockades, and neckties of the same color, in
curious contrast to their simple peasant dress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
In accordance with the provincial custom, it
was a day of feasting to signalize their admission
to the army. In two weeks they were to
leave their homes to begin the long, tedious
period of military service. A young <i>cuirassier</i>
whom we met in Limoges, and who had just
completed his first year of service in the cavalry,
related interesting experiences of life in the
French army. The discipline is severe. The
German soldier is not subjected to a more
rigorous training. The rising hour is 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
in the spring, and 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> in the summer. There
are long, exhausting marches. As often as two
or three times a week the recruits are awakened
in the middle of the night to make a long
march. Life is made to conform as closely as
possible to the conditions of actual war. A
day's work of eighteen hours is not unusual.
Naturally, this means hardship, but it also
means good soldiers. The French army is
very democratic. Rich and poor are treated
alike. Both live together in the barracks.
There are no privileges. Even if a recruit is
wealthy, he is not allowed to keep a valet.
Every man is his own domestic. The German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
army is not nearly so democratic. There, if
the recruit has means, he can keep a servant
and may live out of barracks in a comfortable
apartment.</p>

<p>The conscripts whom we saw in Nonancourt
were destined to anything but an easy, inactive
life. For infantry as well as cavalry there is
the same grueling routine. The three hours of
drilling in the morning do not include gymnasium
exercises for three-quarters of an hour.
Such menial duties as peeling potatoes, or
washing dishes and clothes, form part of the
morning's work. The short noon respite is
followed by three hours of military exercises.
During this period of training the recruits
receive only one cent a day, besides clothing,
guns, and very simple fare. The term of
service has recently been extended from two
to three years, to offset the increases of the
German army. The average age of enlistment
is about eighteen years, an age when the
American boy is entering college or laying the
foundation for a business career. In comparison,
the French boy is heavily handicapped.
Even if his school days end at the age of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
sixteen, he can do little in business. The French
business man does not think it worth while to
prepare the boy for an important position, since
his military service is so close at hand. France
pays a terrible price for national security. The
financial cost, burdensome though it is, is the
smallest item. Frenchmen who have lived in
the United States often speak of the great
advantages enjoyed by the young American
who can devote to his education or to his life
work those three precious years which the
French youth must give to the army.</p>

<p>Anatole France, the distinguished French
writer, was among those who protested against
the new military law. "This addition of a year
to the conscription comes on us just when France
is moving forward with a new energy, both in
science and industry. It will be a grave blow
to all our higher life. Medicine especially will
be injured, for the medicine of the army is not
the medicine of the civil state. French science
requires the time of its young students, and that
will be gravely curtailed. The demand for
another army year from all young Frenchmen,
imposed without any exemptions, will draw off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the best from every field of life. It comes at
a moment of great industrial development. It
will check that development. It comes at a
moment of expansion in our arts, especially in
sculpture. It will be a heavy blow. Sculpture
is not practiced on the battlefield."</p>

<p>We wonder if there is any help for Europe!
How will it all end? So far as we can now foresee,
the peace conference at The Hague, to
have been held in 1915, has been indefinitely
postponed. Instead of this gathering of the
nations to establish some practical basis for
limitation of armaments, there is the prospect
of increased armaments. The burdens, already
so crushing, are apparently only the prelude to
what is coming. England is the pacemaker on
the sea. Mr. Winston Churchill, in his recent
speech before the House of Commons, urged
that the naval budget for 1915 be raised to over
a quarter billion dollars. He said: "The
naval estimates for the next year are the largest
in British history, $257,750,000. The causes
which might lead to a general war have not been
removed. The world is arming as it never
armed before. All attempts at arresting it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
have been ineffectual." Germany is more than
ever a nation in arms. At the present rate of
increase, her standing army in time of peace
will soon number more than a million men.
France, which less than a year ago passed the
Three Years' Service Bill, already faces the
possible necessity of adding still another year
to the term of military service.</p>

<p>Count Witte, the Russian statesman, has
estimated that forty per cent of the total income
of the great powers is absorbed by their armies
and navies. He said: "Unless the great states
which have set this hideous example agree to
call a halt and to knit their subjects into a
pacific, united Europe, war is the only issue I
can perceive. And when I say war, I mean a
conflict which will surpass in horror the most
brutal armed conflicts known to human history,
and entail distress more widespread and more
terrible than living men can realize."</p>

<p>Russia is making sweeping military reforms.
The disastrous war with Japan taught valuable
lessons. The reorganization of the army includes
vast increases of men, and especially the
improvement in facilities of transportation. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
railroad network in process of construction on
her western frontier will probably be completed
in 1915. When the plans of the Czar are realized
in 1917, Russia will have one of the most formidable
armies in the world, a war machine with
a fighting strength of over four million men.</p>

<p>"Throughout Austria-Hungary there is just
now a feeling of considerable dread of Russia's
ulterior motives in a number of measures,
military and otherwise, that are being discussed
in political circles here. Of greatest moment in
that connection is a short but vigorous speech
made by the Hungarian premier, Count Tisza,
before the Parliament. It was delivered while
advocating the new army increase bill (since
adopted by a large majority), which raises considerably
the annual quota of recruits. After
bewailing the necessity of imposing new burdens
on a nation impoverished and already staggering
under its load, he termed the contemplated
increase in the fighting strength of the army an
absolute necessity. 'The shadows of a coming
big war are thrown ahead, and the losing side
will forfeit its national life, or at least expect a
painful amputation,' he cried."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>In every country where we motored there was
scarcely an hour which did not bring the sound
of drums, the sight of barracks, of soldiers drilling
or on the march. Whether in Germany,
Austria, Italy, or France, there were the same
sights of preparation for war. The sacrifices of
peace in 1914 are hardly less exhausting than
were the sacrifices of war in 1813.</p>

<p>"What a reflection on modern diplomacy the
whole situation casts! A policy which men like
Gray and Asquith have repeatedly characterized
as one of madness, as one leading to bankruptcy,
as one that makes a mockery of peace by throwing
away half its benefits, is pursued because the
diplomats can't agree on a plan of armament
limitation. It is admitted that the frenzied
rivalry in armament increase adds nothing to
the relative strength of any power or group of
powers, yet the frenzied rivalry continues at
the expense of industry and constructive social
and economical reforms. If the 'causes of a
general war' in Europe have not been removed,
what has diplomacy been doing and of what
use are the alliances, the ententes, and understandings
among the powers? Might not a

armament-limitation idea and appealing to public,
business, and democratic sentiment force
the hands of the routine-ridden diplomats?"</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Seine at Rouen</i> <i>Page 210</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>For nearly twenty miles the road cut a white
swath through the treeless plain of St. André to
the cathedral town of Evreux. The wheat fields
and cathedrals of Normandy should be mentioned
in the same sentence. France, so full of
the picturesque, has few finer sights than the
view of these airy cathedral spires while one is
still miles away from any town. We zigzagged
into the valley of Iton, climbed, swooped
downward, and crossing that hurrying stream,
ran beside the river Eure into the main street of
Louviers. The warning, "<i>Allure modère</i>," was
unnecessary. The cobble stones were sufficient
to make us slacken speed. The beauty of the
church of Nôtre Dame served to stop us completely.
The church, with its profuse embroidery
of rich, delicate carving, shone like a
jewel amid the motley and jumbled houses. It
was like finding a rosebush blooming in the
gutter of some neglected street. Through the
forest of Pont de l'Arche to the town of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
name, where we crossed the Seine, past bright
little Norman cottages, our route shot ahead to
Rouen, the center of cotton manufacturing for
France, the most interesting mediæval city in
Normandy, and renowned the world over for
splendid Gothic churches. After inspecting the
rooms of two or three hotels, we chose the Hôtel
d'Angleterre, close by the crowded traffic of the
Seine.</p>

<p>Sight-seeing in Rouen is more convenient by
carriage than by motor car. We moved from
the abbey church of St. Ouen to the church of
St. Maclou. If Europe had no other remains of
Gothic art, Rouen would be enough to describe
all the splendor of that style of architecture.
The cathedral is a whole library of description
in itself. Curious is the legend of the Tour de
Beurre, built by money received from indulgences
sold, and permitting the people to eat
butter in Lent.</p>

<p>"At the base of the Tour St. Romain, there
still stands the lodge of the porter whose duties
from very early times right up to 1760, included
the care of the fierce watchdogs who were at
night let loose in the cathedral to guard its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
many precious treasures from robbers. How
much would we give for a glimpse of one of those
porters walking through the cavernous gloom of
these echoing aisles, with his lamp throwing
strange shadows from the great slouching dogs!"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The central tower rises into a great spire of
open iron work, more than one and a half times
as high as the steeple of Trinity Church in New
York. One seldom sees anything so quaintly
picturesque as the little wooden cloister, Aître
Saint-Maclou. From its courtyard, the burial
ground for so many victims of the Black Death
of 1348, one sees mediæval spires which rise in
all directions. Another vivid reminder of the
past is the archway of the Grosse Horloge,
with its huge clock in colors of blue and gold
and dating from the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>But the impressions of Rouen that thrilled us
most related to the sad closing days of Jeanne
d'Arc. At Orléans we saw her in the hour of
victory, a young girl dictating to experienced
generals, cutting her way through the English
army around the city and bringing provisions
and succor to the beleaguered inhabitants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Our <i>cocher</i> escorted us to the tower where,
with instruments of torture around her, she
faced and baffled her brutal inquisitors. In the
old market place, the scene of her martyrdom,
one is shown a simple slab which reads, "Jeanne
d'Arc, 30 Mai, 1431." This marks the spot
where she was burned at the stake.</p>

<p>The last lap of the trip, the ride to Dieppe on
the English Channel, was past many large
Norman farms. Neat haystacks dotted the
rolling acres. Nowhere else had we seen so
many horses,&mdash;big, powerful creatures. Normandy
breeds and exports them. Apple orchards
were in constant view. Coasting down
a long hill into the city, we left the car in the
garage of the Grand Hôtel, and joined an
enthusiastic crowd which was watching a football
game between Dieppe and Rouen.</p>

<p>The new France is keenly interested in sports
and games. In 1912 there was held in Paris the
International Congress for Physical Culture, the
idea being to impress upon the young the need
for physical development. The extent to which
the idea of physical culture has captured France
will be evident from the following figures: in 1896
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a><br /></span>the various athletic societies had less than fifty
thousand members; to-day, they have more
than three hundred thousand members. France
has indeed entered upon a new era. The chief
characteristic of it is not literary but practical,
self-assertive, and everywhere for action. The
young Frenchman of to-day is more interested
in sports than in art or literature. A French
professor recently said: "I have lived my life
in my library. There I have passed through
my intellectual crises. There I have experienced
my most fervent emotions. In the lives
of my sons I notice that books play a very little
part, or if they read, it is biography, and
especially the biography of men of action like
Napoleon."</p>

<p>Now comes the pang of keen regret. We are
close to the end. These weeks of unmingled joy
stand around us like a group of friends, as if to
stay our leaving. Four thousand miles of
motoring, in five countries, and without an
accident! Our car has taken on personality.
Here, climbing a mountain to the very summit
whose far-away vistas held us enchanted, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
rushing down on the other side, we skirted some
quiet lake that lay embosomed in its own loveliness;
there, a wild glen with its mysterious
depths beckoning us to halt! We have seen
the peasantry, as in France, looked upon their
quaint costumes and customs, and caught the
simple melody of their songs. We have gone
close to palaces, and wondered whether prince
or peasant were the happier. We have seen
châteaux that were tragedies and cathedrals
that were poems. We have seen the conscripts
file slowly past, each surrendering three years
of the most important period of his life. Then,
we have contrasted a nation as a military camp
with our own great republic, without a large
standing army, but safe. And now, homeward
bound to the freest land beneath the sun,
America!</p>

EXPENSES AND SUGGESTIONS</h2>


<p>The purchase of the car at the Benz factory
in Mannheim, Germany, plunged
us at once into a maze of police regulations.
It was necessary to secure a driving license.
With us in the United States this is hardly
more than a matter of routine. Not so in
Germany, where the examination is really a
formidable affair. It is especially difficult for
a foreigner to secure a driving license. He may
be able to give evidence proving that he has
driven a car for years in his own country.
This fact makes no difference. It is not even
taken into consideration. Every possible opportunity
is given the candidate to make
mistakes, and thus to prove that he is not
qualified to receive the desired certificate.
No detail of motormanship is overlooked. There
is an age requirement of eighteen years. First
came the physical examination. Then it was
necessary to spend two hours a day in the shop
for five and a half weeks so as to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
thoroughly acquainted with the various parts
of the motor car. The candidate is given an
opportunity to see motor cars taken apart and
put together. In this way he is made familiar
with the use and purpose of every part of the
car. The crucial test begins when he is called
upon to show his skill as chauffeur. It is customary
to drive one hundred miles in the city
and surrounding country. The official police
inspector who accompanies him is resourceful
in his tests. Under his supervision the car is
driven through crowded streets, and made to
back up and turn around in difficult places,&mdash;in
fact, to meet all the emergencies of motor
travel. Even after the examination has been
passed successfully, there is a delay of several
days before the license is given the final stamp
of official approval. The license for which we
made application on February 22 was not
secured until April 10. It cost one hundred
<i>marks</i> (about twenty-five dollars). Of this
amount, one half goes to the state and the
balance to the shop giving the candidate his
instruction in motor-car mechanics. The inspector
receives ten dollars for his services.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
There is also a customary charge of one dollar
and a half for the number plate.</p>

<p>Americans who have lived for a considerable
time in Germany are always impressed with
the numerous occasions when the state interferes
in the private life of the individual; the
foreign motorist is no exception to this rule of
coming at once into contact with the state. He
no sooner crosses the frontier than the state
compels him to pay a tax. Even though he
remains in the country but a single day, he is
forced to secure a tax license which costs three
<i>marks</i> (about seventy-five cents). These tax
licenses are issued to cover periods of from
one to ninety days, the license good for three
months costing fifty <i>marks</i>. If one remains
longer than ninety days it is necessary to
renew this license or <i>Steuerkarte</i>. The annual
tax on motor cars varies according to the power
of the car. A car of 13.9 horse power (German
rating) would be taxed one hundred and twenty
<i>marks</i>. The German tax net spreads everywhere.
At the time of our sojourn in that
country the city of Munich was considering
the introduction of a tax on cats. Such a tax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
would without doubt be the first of its kind
in the world. In southern Germany the small
towns still continue to exact imposts of ten
<i>pfennigs</i> (three cents) from the motor cars
passing over their roads. In spite of the complaint
that this tax is a serious obstacle to
trade and traffic, there is no immediate prospect
of its being removed. France, in contrast to
Germany, does not subject the foreign motorist
to a tax unless his sojourn exceeds a period of
four months.</p>

<p>The annual dues of the Rheinische Automobile
Club amounted to forty <i>marks</i>. Membership
in an organization of this kind is necessary to
secure the <i>triptyques</i> which are so indispensable
to the motorist whose itinerary includes several
countries of Europe. The usefulness of this
important document has been described so
often that we do not feel called upon to make
further comment here. Our international driving
permit based upon the special license issued
by the state was also secured for a small fee
from the automobile club above mentioned.</p>

<p>Among the incidental expenses, the cost of
repairs is apt to figure largely, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
when one is motoring along mountain highways.
Such services are much cheaper in
Europe than in the United States. In our
case the item was so small as to be almost
negligible. The car was so carefully overhauled
and inspected before leaving the factory that
we suffered little inconvenience or delay. Our
tire troubles were limited to a single puncture.
Continental tires in the rear and Excelsior in
the front gave excellent service. Notwithstanding
the wear and tear of mountain motoring,
we found it necessary to use only one of
the two reserve tires.</p>

<p>Gasoline was everywhere obtainable. In
Germany and France the price is about thirty-seven
cents a gallon, but in Austria and Spain
it is much higher, generally approximating
eighty cents a gallon. In Italy, where bargaining
is necessary, the price usually dropped
from eighty cents to less than forty-eight cents
a gallon. A Bosch magneto greatly increased
the speed and climbing ability of the car, and
enabled us to average about twenty-one miles
to every gallon of gasoline. In France the
cost of this necessary article is not fixed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Neighboring towns often showed a difference
of several cents in the cost per gallon. But
although the price is not uniform, the fine
quality is, and always gave excellent results.
As a part of our equipment we carried as
reserve a five-gallon sealed can of gasoline and
a similar quantity of oil. On these it was
occasionally necessary to pay a duty of a couple
of cents at the numerous <i>octroi</i> stations in
France. The inconvenience of these imposts
was usually more burdensome than the amount
of the tax. For our oil, which would have cost
about forty cents a gallon in the United States,
we averaged one dollar and ten cents a gallon.</p>

<p>Our hotel bills were not high. We had
expected to find them much higher. Two
dollars or two dollars and a half was sufficient
as a rule to cover dinner, chamber, and breakfast.
For instance, our rooms at the Hôtel
de France cost one dollar each, the dinner
<i>table d'hôte</i> seventy-five cents each, and breakfast
thirty cents, the usual prices which secured
us satisfactory accommodations nearly everywhere
in France. Every hotel had its garage,
a fact which we did not always find to be true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
of the hotels in Germany. The garage was
often not much more than a shed or lean-to,
but it always offered the shelter and protection
necessary for our one-or two-night stops.
Sometimes there was a garage charge of one
franc (nineteen and one half cents) a day,
but this was exceptional. If the car was
washed we were expected to pay from thirty-five
to fifty cents for this extra service. The
scale of prices in Germany and Austria was
possibly twenty per cent higher, but nowhere
was there any attempt to take advantage of
the fact that we were foreigners.</p>

<p>The motor tourist is such a familiar sight
abroad that the stopping of a motor car before
a provincial hotel does not excite unusual
interest. It is rather an everyday occurrence,
an accustomed detail of the day's routine.
France especially, more than any other country
in Europe, has become a land of motor tourists.
The large well-to-do class turns naturally to
motoring for recreation and diversion.</p>

<p>The Frenchman practices thrift in his hours
of leisure and travel as well as in his business.
This fact probably explains in great part the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
comparatively low level of hotel charges to
be found in that country. Contrary to the
popular idea, there are not two sets of charges,
one for the European and a higher one for the
American. We were never expected to pay
for services that were not rendered in more
than ample measure. On the contrary, we
had daily opportunities to observe the effort
made to give us the best possible service for
the prices charged. This was true not only
of the hotels but of the restaurants as well.
Of course, for a dollar a day we did not expect
to have a <i>chambre de luxe</i>. It is really a constant
surprise to see how much one can get
in the way of clean, comfortable rooms and
appetizing meals for a small outlay.</p>

<p>France is a country by itself in this respect.
There is perhaps no country where the traveler
can get so much for his money. In no other
land of Europe can one motor so cheaply. It
is always possible to avoid the big towns as
sleeping places and at meal times, and yet
run no risk of not enjoying the finest cooking
and a comfortable night's lodging. Austria
is the most expensive country for the motorist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Spain and central and southern Italy are so
little patronized by motor traffic that they do
not need to be included in our comparison.</p>

<p>The consideration of incidental expenses brings
us to the question of tipping, without doubt the
most perplexing and the most misunderstood
of all the problems that confront the foreign
motorist in Europe. Long before his steamer
touches the shore of the Old World, he has
visions of an extended line of servants standing
with outstretched hands to receive the expected
shower of coins. For the majority of tourists
it is almost an ordeal to leave a European hotel.
How often we have heard the question, "What
shall I give?" The average American has such
an instinctive sense of fairness, of wanting to do
the right thing, that a matter of this kind
assumes an importance out of all proportion to
the value of the tip. He is willing to be liberal;
on the other hand, he is not eager to pose as a
philanthropic and charitable institution created
to satisfy the needs of every hotel employee
who says "<i>Guten Tag</i>" or "<i>Bon jour</i>" to him
when he enters the hotel. The trouble is that in
borrowing this custom from Europe we have so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Americanized it that we find it difficult to get
the European viewpoint and to adapt ourselves
readily to the practice as it exists to-day across
the water. The American <i>voyageur</i> is so accustomed
to doing things in a large way that
it is not easy for him to appreciate the European
system of small percentages. His common mistake
is to give larger tips than are expected and
overlook the small tips which do not seem to be
so important. He hesitates to give a small tip,
and in such cases would prefer to give none
at all.</p>

<p>We have read somewhere the story of a
Frenchman who was visiting the United States
for the first time. He ate a sixty-cent meal in
a New York restaurant. Following the custom
in Paris, he left five per cent of the bill, three
cents, for the waiter. Many of us could probably
confess to an equal uncertainty and helplessness
in the presence of our first tipping
experience in Europe. Baedeker's classic rule
of ten per cent of the total amount of the bill
seems strangely inadequate when a traveler has
stayed only one night at a hotel and finds that
his bill is about two dollars. The problem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
dividing twenty cents so that every one will be
satisfied is a task that he would willingly turn
over to somebody else. As a matter of fact,
while there is no arbitrary rule, it does not take
long to discover that the <i>pourboire</i> and <i>Trinkgeld</i>
are fixed and permanent institutions, as
solid in their reality as the Credit Lyonnais or
the Reichsbank. One is expected to give at least
something, even if the service rendered has been
merely nominal. The French and German
systems of coinage, with their <i>5-centime</i> and <i>10-pfennig</i>
pieces, fit in so conveniently to the
European standards of tipping. Judging from
our experience, the tourist will be most quickly
at ease who observes the custom as it is practiced
by the inhabitants of the country, and then
makes his own scale of tips slightly larger.
Foreigners are expected to be a little more
liberal. The quality of service received will
ordinarily more than compensate for this
slight increase. In Valence, where we stayed
only one night, the bill, including chamber,
dinner, and breakfast, amounted to twenty
francs for two people. Our tips were itemized
as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td>FRANCS</td><td>CENTIMES</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Total</td><td>2</td><td align="left">75</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>If there was an <i>ascenseur</i> in the hotel the
elevator boy never looked insulted when we gave
him ten or fifteen <i>centimes</i>. If extra service
was rendered, we paid for it accordingly. This
scale of tipping secured us good service in the
small provincial towns. In the larger places
the <i>maître de l'hôtel</i> (head waiter) plays a more
important role and ranks in tipping dignity
with the <i>concierge</i>. In Italy the equivalent of
four cents per person would be considered
liberal in most restaurants. In Germany,
where the rise in cost of living is more noticeable
than in France, the item of tipping was slightly
larger. Austria gave us the most difficulty.
Here the system is more complicated. The
<i>Speise-traeger</i> who brings you food, the <i>Piccolo</i>
who ministers to your thirst, the <i>Zahl-kellner</i>
who receives payment for the bill, all expect
their contribution of <i>hellers</i>. These dignitaries
were ordinarily satisfied with tips of twenty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
ten, and forty <i>hellers</i> in the order named.
The value of <i>hellers</i> and <i>centimes</i> is so nearly
equal that it was not confusing to pass from
the Austrian to the French system of coinage.</p>

<p>The largest single item of expense was of
course the cost of transportation, which always
depends on the size and weight of the car.
The cost of ocean transportation for an ordinary
four-seated touring car would run from one
hundred and twenty-five to one hundred and
seventy-five dollars. To this amount must be
added fifty dollars to cover cost of boxing. In
our case, since the car was purchased abroad, it
was necessary to pay a duty of thirty per cent
on the original cost, minus the agent's commission
of twenty-five per cent.</p>
